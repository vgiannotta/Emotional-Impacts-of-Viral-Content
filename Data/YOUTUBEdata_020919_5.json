All Colin furze, did was replicate the technology in a backyard experiment, he did not invent it, nor did he make a saleable version of the bike.\n\nChris Malloy is developing another Hoverbike and made a prototype 6 years ago in 2012 here is a link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpMZBp20JoI - plus he has a kickstarter page to develop it, here is the Kickstarter Link = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1524806320/hoverbike\n\nSo to sum up all Colin Furze did was replicate technology that has been around for along time and he was not the first to make a hoverbike.\n\n*2) The Exposed blades make this bike too dangerous and will never be approved* - You are most likely correct, it will probably never get approved in it's current form with exposed blades, but the bike is deemed an \"extreme sports machine\" which means it comes with a high level of danger attached to using it. I am sure at some point maybe even now \"parachute flight suits\" would be considered \"extreme\" make a small mistake you splat into the ground or a rock, have you seen how close people come to hitting the ground using that suit.\n\nextreme recreational machines & technology always look dangerous, but there will always be people who love the extreme and will buy and use them. But overtime they will make them more user friendly and design them better for the mass market, but always keeping a level of \"extreme\" in the design.\n\n*3) Why don't they put shrouds or covers over the blades* - for all those that watched the Colin Furze video when he made his backyard version of a hoverbike, you will have seen shrouds make you lose thrust, he had to give rid of his shrouds to make the bike fly. But you could still put a basic wire frame and chicken wire type mesh over the blades, but would be wonky & unstable. I am not an engineer so I do not know the answer, unless you are an engineer neither do you.\n\n*4) $59,000 is too much for that bike* - All new technology starts off expensive, to help cover the design and prototype costs, but over time they refine the product and build it quicker & cheaper, but I doubt the price will ever come down much until they make it safer for the mass market.", "reply": "You are nampir plis"}, {"topLevelComment": "funny thing is that colin furze literally just a guy on youtube made one before\n this i think"}, {"topLevelComment": "Arabs will chop criminals head off while chasing.

Heres is my equasion : 2=1 simple as that :) The universe is a paradox on every scale. There are allwats 2 things which at the and are 1 thing, and one thing is 2 things at the same time. Simple as that. Here are some examples : 1 Human = 2 parts - Body and soul ? Body and soul = 1 human get it ? Now apply my math principle to everything you know and you dont know. You will find that there are minimum of 2 things in everything which form one thing at the end/ or beggining!  Plus and minus = two directions of a single study ? Day and night ? Black and white ? Male and Female ? Get it ? Ok this geniuses math is probably correct i do not know cause i had to paint the fence in 12 grade to pass in mathematics. But how come i describe one phenomenom in my own words w/o doing the math to prove it and other guys describe the same phenomenom in another way? Isnt that phenomenom one at the same ? There you go my math is correct again! Well i cant prove it but it is still there right ? I can still observe it ? So lets take this to the biggest scale we think we know. Hmmmm the universe ? By my math it is obvious that the universe itself is one, but it the same time it consists of minimum of 2 things ? Help me out O gr8t physicists ! Matter and antymatter or what ever ? Visible and invisble ? Matter and antymatter ? Whatever names you put on your observations  you will find at the end that ther are always 2 things in the opposite directions (which for 1 ) - which is the reality itself . Lets say +10 and -10 = this space between is the reality itself. Whats the combined result of -10 and + 10 ? 0 ? So we can have a same outcome with +100 and - 100 ? again 0 ? There is something i call by my understanding and words - \"the greater logic\" which means that everything is logical although we cant put it or explain it trough our own logic ?  Let me give you example about the argument about \"destiny\" and \"i forge my own destiny\"  (the math again ! 2 camps = 1 phenomenom in the distance) Ok. Lets say you made a decision about smth and you do it ! That decision just made is formed on your expirience and knoledge and whatever led you to be here or there that day or another right ? So you made this decision yourself or the decision is a projection of yourself ? If the first is correct you must forge your own destiny but if the secound is correct you have a predetermined destiny, right ? Well here goes the math again 2=1. Both things are actually one and the same thing. YOu can call it whatever you like but the outcome is 100% the same everytime. So what do we have here again ? Destiny and \"i forge my own destiny\" are one and the same thing ! Just to prove all this ask me the greatest questions humanity didnt answer and i will give you the answer aplying this paradox math and greter logic !

If you're interested in the technical details, read on!\r\n\r\nEquipment used: \r\n\r\n- Computer: MacBook Pro laptop with Windows installed\r\n- Monitor - 24\" Asus: We had to replace the standard fluorescent backlight with very large tungsten fixtures to funnel in more light to capture the screen. In addition, we flipped the monitor 180 degrees to eliminate a shadow from the driver board and set the system preferences on the computer to rotate 180 degrees. No special software was used in this process.\r\n- Camera: Phantom v640 High Speed Camera at 1920 x 1080, films up to 2700 fps\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why does allrecipes.com in the potato gun sequence appear at once, and not the text first and images second? And why does it appear to render from bottom of the screen to the top?\"\r\n\r\nChrome sends the rendered page to the video card buffer all at once, which is why allrecipes.com appears at once, and not with the text first and images second. Chrome actually paints the page from top to bottom, but to eliminate a shadow from the driver board, we had to flip the monitor upside down and set the system preferences in Windows to rotate everything 180 degrees, resulting in the page appearing to render from bottom to top.\r\n\r\n\"Why does the top one third of the page appear first on the weather.com page load?\"\r\n\r\nSometimes only half the buffer gets filled before the video card sends its buffer over to the LCD panel. This is because Chrome on Windows uses GDI to draw, which does not do v-sync.\r\n\r\n\"The screen wipes are so smooth - how was that achieved?\"\r\n\r\nThe screen wipes up in a gradated wipe because LCD pixels take around 10ms to flip and gradually change color.\r\n\r\nMore filming details below:\r\n\r\nChrome Browser vs. Potato:\r\nWe used a version of the web page allrecipes.com that is accessible when logged in. About four hours into the Potato Gun shoot we decided to use a locally loaded version of the web page to enable more precise synchronization with the potato gun. We finally got the shot we were hoping for after 51 takes.\r\n\r\nChrome Browser vs. Sound:\r\nWe loaded an artist page from Pandora.com, a streaming internet radio service directly off the web on a 15Mbps internet connection.\r\n\r\nChrome Browser vs. Lightning:\r\nWe used a locally loaded version of weather.com that was legally approved for use in this video (and all the standard website permissions procedures that goes into making videos!)\r\n\r\nWhile we had a super fast 15Mbps internet connection in the studio, any live internet connection introduces quite a bit of variability. To run speed tests on page rendering times, saving locally and loading from the local disk can help reduce this variability.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor behind-the-scenes footage of how this video was made:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oarMXGq3gI", "viewCount": "9140647", "likeCount": "31836", "dislikeCount": "1754", "commentCount": "6024", "comments": [{"topLevelComment": "\u0130n 2019"}, {"topLevelComment": "Ah.

It goes beyond that idea of just letting introverts be themselves, because there is still a brick wall called \"projection\" that flags our own outliers as indicative of our problems. If being myself in a comfortable fashion varies for me day-to-day, and someone assumes what is my 'normal' mode of operation and decides that my spaciness is an indication of a personal problem, it puts me in a box.\n\n\nI hope that, as human beings, we learn to be more thoughtful and open-minded about the variety of existence."}, {"topLevelComment": "Hi I am an extrovert and I feel dumb now, I realized I do hide in group works probably because of my inability to be creative in problem solving, please help.

They were raised in the same home, with the same parents, had the same IQ, same skills and same opportunities. Each was married and had two children. They were all carpenters making $25 per hour.\n\nWhile they were very similar in all these respects, they had different priorities.\n \nFor example, Tom, chose to work 20 hours per week, while his brother, Dick worked 40 hours and Harry 60. \n\nIt should also be noted that Harry's wife worked full time as an office manager for a salary of $50,000.  Dick's wife sold real estate part time 10 hours a week and made $25,000 per year. Tom's wife did not work. \n\nTom and Dick spent all of their family income. Since they paid into Social Security they figured, they didn't need to save for retirement. Harry and his wife, on the other hand, had, over many years, put away money each month and invested it in stocks and bonds. \n\nHere's how it worked out: Tom made $25,000 a year, Dick and his wife made $75,000 and Harry and his wife, $150,000. \n\nWhen a new housing development opened up in their community, the brothers decided to buy equally-priced homes on the same private street.  \n\nOne day the brothers decided to pool their funds for the purpose of improving their street. Concerned about crime and safety, and wanting a more attractive setting for their homes, the three families decided to install a security gate at the street's entrance; repave the street's surface; and enhance the lighting and landscaping. The work was done for a total cost of $30,000.\n\nHarry assumed they would divide the bill three ways, each brother paying $10,000. But Tom and Dick objected. \"Why should we pay the same as you?\" they said. \"You make much more money than we do.\" Harry was puzzled. \"What does that have to do with anything?\" he asked. \"My family makes more money because my wife and I work long hours, and because we have saved some of the money we've earned to make additional money from investments. Why should we be penalized for that?\"\n\n\"Harry, you can work and save all you like\" Tom countered. \"But my wife and I want to enjoy ourselves now, not 25 years from now.\" \n\n\"Fine, Tom. Do what you want. It's a free country. But why should I have to pay for that?\n\n\"I can't believe your being so... unbrotherly,\" Tom argued. \"You have a lot of money and I don't. I thought you'd be more generous.\"\n\nAt this point, Dick, the peacemaker in the family, entered the conversation. \"I've got an idea,\" Dick said. \"Our combined income is $250,000, and $30,000 is 12 percent of that amount. Why don't we each pay that percentage of our income? Under that formula, Tom would pay $3,000, I would pay $9,000, and Harry would pay $18,000.\"\n\n\"I have a much better idea,\" said Tom. \"And one that's fairer than what you're proposing.\"\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/progressive-income-tax-tale-three-brothers", "viewCount": "7824228", "likeCount": "63316", "dislikeCount": "20279", "commentCount": "19738", "comments": [{"topLevelComment": "liberals heads must explode if they ever see something like this.  with no logical way to combat the fact they look like thieves they'll have to just scream \"racist\""}, {"topLevelComment": "lol dick"}, {"topLevelComment": "1) The basic premise is flawed. The Supreme Court famously said it best, \"Separate is inherently unequal\". The video presumes an equality of upbringing and educational opportunity that doesn't exist. People also have different jobs that are absolutely essential to a functioning society, and yet those jobs may not reward them as greatly economically. They may have had learning disabilities, and other disadvantages through no fault of their own. This analogy renders these people invisible. Their analogy is pretty much the ONLY possible way to make a progressive tax system unfair. Therefore the entire analogy is BS, but let's humor them... \r\n\r\n2) The other assumption is that the rich all just smarter and \"worked harder\". While many wealthy people are absolutely, intelligent, hard-working-dedicated people, there are advantages (i.e. Bill Gates and Paul Allen) and wealth (i.e. Trump) that have come to people who did nothing to \"earn\" their gift of birth or parentage. Not only that, but the portrayal of the low-earner is completely insulting to those who are working class. \r\n\r\n3) It presumes that the working class and middle class are the sole drivers of this. Mark Cuban, Warren Buffett, etc. have called for a more progressive tax system, or increase in minimum wages. \r\n\r\n4) Finally, infrastructure and improvements and public safety are wrongly presumed to offer equal benefits. Yes, EVERYONE benefits, but they especially benefit the wealthy and their bottom lines more than anyone."}, {"topLevelComment": "I'd just send their wives out on the streets until i get the respective money back.

The ultra-wealthy (the group impacted by the theoretical highest tax rate) didnt get that way because of working more hours, thst wealth was earned though either in-demand skill (doctors, popular artists) or buisness, running companies, investing, exc. At that level, Wealth was not earned through direct labor, it wad earned passivevly, often with the assistance of goverment meddling via regulations, subsidies, benefits to reduce labor costs, exc. Its absurd to claim Jeff Bezos worked thousand times more hours than the janitor, or the value of his labor is literally 1000x higher. Instead, the things he owned (stock) increased in value, ballooning his net worth. The increase in value happens in a system where subsidzes and uncompetitive markets abound, enabling the accumulation of vast wealth. Therefor, a higher tax rate on the wealthy isnt punishing the hard working, its taxing the people who benefit the most from the system", "reply": "Then why don't everyone do that if they can get richer?

In those days, bands played, and played, and played--they became really good and what they did and also got a lot of immediate feedback from audiences.  Popular radio was not so programmed and segmented.  During my childhood and and into my 20s, I hear rock, pop, Motown, soul, maybe a bit of country and rockabilly.  I just don't think we get that today.  Also, shows like Ed Sullivan, and other variety/talk shows, introduced acts to a very wide audience.  Again, today our entertainment seems much more narrow-cast.  I'm sure that there are great songwriters and musicians working today, but \"popular\" music doesn't seem to shows us much of that.  \n\nInterestingly, I was speaking with a co-worker who said his 12-year-old doesn't seem to like anything that isn't auto-tuned.

And I really meant it in my head I was looking forward for that butt. When tomorrow came, I realized I wasn\u2019t anymore anxious and that I could do it again and tell myself tomorrow I will have one. I finally dumped all the cigs. out but 1. I left 1 in the pack and still kept telling myself that tomorrow I will smoke it. Which now meant if I smoked it I would have to run out and buy some. So that was a turn off and I got through each day tricking the brain for about 10 days. When finally I got threw it away. Also on the first day I got rid of all parifinalia that triggered a butt.

Unfortunately, it is not a natural capacity to tap any more for most of us in this busy age and chaotic times. This is the reason why the talk started with the meditation subject. With the practice of mindfulness meditation, the gap between trigger and actual compulsive reaction (the act of doing it) lengthens via the mind processing ahead of time the pros and cons, and the feel-good\u00a0sensation before such old habit action can take place. In the end, consciousness has to take charge and decide (as experienced when having a withdrawal symptom or self-doubt midway). Hopefully, with trust and release- letting go of all perceived old feel-good consequences, this is done many times until the subconscious learns it as the new pattern and one will be free of the negatives holding it back.

Great movie, not a masterpiece but this movie certainly deserved better than that kind of treatment. To think that they only played it twice in one day (3pm and 8pm) and made it share the same showroom as BUMBLEBEE that's been playing there for almost a month now in three other separate show rooms, showed how very little hope they had for this movie to make any money. Alita and Bumblebee took up the entire cinema with gigantic posters and trailer previews outside the mall and they can't even give the green book it's own projection room. Nobody else saw it but me. I planned on seeing it for months now but it took a while to get here so I was in time for the first screening. I've never experienced watching a movie in the cinema, literally all alone. I don't think they even expected anyone to see it cause when I went in, they turned on all the lights and the projector was out of focus.

I myself am an autodidact and have studied philosophy for 10 years and what I find interesting is that his and my opinions relate quite a bit even though I've not taken the academic route. It must be related to convergent evolution in that great minds think alike. What I find interesting about this conversation is that truth has a limit to its parking space and that is evident with this exchange. It's like the opposition is trying to inhabit his space which they cannot share because in order to do so the context of that person's belief system has to be compatible with it. Part of humanity is a sombre to the reality we inhabit in that life as we know it attempts to encapsulate it, especially to the point a system generates conflict internally. That is how opposition manifests itself and I can't overstate that we aren't just competing with each other but with the reality of the situation. One reality that we will likely deal with will be the rise of our tools; AI. The idea of the possibility of having multiple identities or pronouns maybe related to the polymorphic and adaptational mindset you might require to a technologically changing environment for which power is exchanged over to AI. It would be genetically sound for our species to create a myriad of diversity in order to compete in hopes that someone can stand up to the challenge. So from that point the extent by which we try and adapt extends far beyond what past hominids had to compete with just as other hominids had to compete with us where we'd do something like own a dog as a pet, which is an example of unknown variations that worked at the time and raised naturally at that; as you know dogs being useful for certain tasks humans wouldn't want to waste resources on themselves. I'd go even deeper to state that the pronouns of sexual identity don't justify well enough what it means to be human, but to realize we are made of atoms that can be arranged into different objects. You can be turned into a lobster, a dog, and maybe a hyper intelligent AI; polymorphic. You are what you are, and that's very scary to realize for some people because changing that sometimes requires losing everything."}, {"topLevelComment": "THANK GOD! \"I find the constant conflict exhausting\" 26:59"}, {"topLevelComment": "brilliant, brilliant man!"}, {"topLevelComment": "I can't stand modern feminism but this Peterson guy is one of the smuggest, most patronising self righteous person I've come across..."}, {"topLevelComment": "social obligation???????????????????? for God sake he revolutioned India by almost destorying his life."}, {"topLevelComment": "How would His life be different were He born a woman?

I would say that 2 of the most useful knots are missed.  The fisherman's knot to tie two ropes together, which can also be easily modified into a barrel knot on a bite.  The most useful knot I've found is the alpine butterfly.  You can use it to remove damaged sections of rope so that the rope is still useful, it creates loops on the rope to create multiple anchor points for other ropes or places to clip gear and you can use it as an anchor.  The most important thing to know about knots is to use the right knot for the application.  There are a lot of them that will work, but one works best.  Make sure you select the proper knot because in some cases an improper knot may look identical to the proper knot and the knot will fail.  In some circumstances this could end in death, a prime example is if someone uses a slipknot instead of a barrel knot on a bite and choose to hang from that knot.  Both will look identical, one will fail one won't.  Great video though, lots of very useful stuff here.  A little added note to everyone who doesn't know knots, the bowline is the knot tugboats use to pull large ships.

Today\u00b4s topic is one of the most ask passenger question, \"Can a passenger land a plane?\". There are so many rumours about this question, it\u00b4s just not true. \n\nSo a few facts. My friend Carolin, has no connection to the aviation world besides from flying to holiday once in a while, obviously as a passenger. \nNow as soon as she sat down, the hardest part was establishing a communication between her and me, the ATC controller. Carolin was totally overwhelmed with all the switches and buttons, that it took nearly 20 minutes to find the push to talk button. In a real-life situation, if a plane does not respond within 20 minutes, fighter jets will be on their way intercepting the aeroplane as it causes a potential threat to national security, depending which land you\u00b4re flying across. \n\nOnce communication was established, I had to give her instructions on how to set up the approach phase for an automatic landing, better known as AUTOLAND procedure. The AUTOLAND allows pilots to perform a fully automated landing in bad visual conditions, known as CAT3 approaches. More about that in future videos. \nOnce the approach set up was completed, I had to give her instructions to familiarize with important levers and switches, such as the landing gear lever, the flaps, flight control computer and much more. \nLater I guided her via radar vectors towards the airport, constantly descending and reducing the speed accordingly. \n\nBut see for yourself. \n\nMy opinion if a passenger can land a plane.

Over five minutes, the film explores the bottled water industrys attacks on tap water and its use of seductive, environmental-themed advertising to cover up the mountains of plastic waste it produces. The film concludes with a call to take back the tap, not only by making a personal commitment to avoid bottled water, but by supporting investments in clean, available tap water for all.\n\nOur production partners on the bottled water film include five leading sustainability groups: Corporate Accountability International, Environmental Working Group, Food & Water Watch, Pacific Institute, and Polaris Institute.\n\nAnd, for all you fact checkers out there, http://storyofstuff.org/pdfs/StoryOfBottledWater_pdfs.zip\n\nGET INVOLVED:\nhttp://action.storyofstuff.org/sign/social-action/\n\nFOLLOW US:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/storyofstuff/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/storyofstuff\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/storyofstuff/\n\nSUPPORT THE PROJECT:\nhttps://action.storyofstuff.org/donate/social_donations/\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/BBZ/", "viewCount": "5585645", "likeCount": "33443", "dislikeCount": "1588", "commentCount": "5170", "comments": [{"topLevelComment": "water should be free"}, {"topLevelComment": "I drank bottled water while watching :/"}, {"topLevelComment": "I doubt I will ever get an answer on this because they don't want to face the reality of what may be.

Stupid, because I\u2019m spending money on something I can get for free (almost) from a water faucet?  Stupid, because the creation of a water bottle and its disposal are both very, very un-Earth-friendly.  That is a good question.  I like money.  I like the earth.  I like water.  \r\n\r\nI do drink some water from other places.  I drink from water fountains in public places.  I drink a glass of water in restaurants.  I even drink from a hose occasionally.  But I also buy gallons of filtered water and cheap water bottles at Food Lion or Walmart.  Is that okay?  Is that smart?\r\n\r\nWell, my home sits among corn and bean fields in North Carolina, and the water pumped into my home comes from a well.  On most days it stinks.  Sulfuric.  Disgusting.  Why?  I don\u2019t know.  But I know that when something stinks, my mind tells my tongue to stay away.  And I drink water from plastic containers that costs a little less than a dollar a gallon.  \r\n\r\nSo, it stinks.  And it tastes bad.  But am I basing my views on tap water from personal experience, or have I been duped by the advertising gurus hired by Coke (Dasani) and Pepsi (Aquafina) so they can make more money?  My solution is to do a taste-test, in my kitchen, right now. \r\n\r\nI stopped my typing and just did a taste-test.  Guess which water won, the water from my tap or the filtered water from Walmart?  Drum roll, please.  Tap-tap-tap-tap\u2026  The results:  one tasted softer or smoother (the filtered water) and one tasted thicker or heavier and had a nasty after-taste (my well water).  Sorry tap water.  You don\u2019t taste the same, or better.  \r\n\r\nSo, I prefer bottled water.  Done.  But am I just being picky?  I mean, people have been drinking unfiltered, or poorly-filtered water, for as long as humans (or our ancestors) have lived.  From lakes.  Streams.  Wells.  Can\u2019t I just deal with it and drink the water from my tap?  Yes, I could.  But why would I?  I have a choice.  And I choose filtered (tasteless) water.  \r\n\r\nEnd of story!  Well, not exactly.  What I must come to terms with is the effects that my actions have upon the planet.  If I use several gallons of water each week, both in gallon form and in hand-held one-liter form, then that means that I am throwing away hundreds of plastic containers each year.  Plastic, either ending up in a landfill, or being recycled to create other plastic products.  Products that will remain on this planet, in a pile, in a garbage heap, or shipped off to some distant country for many, many generations.  Out of sight, out of mind.  Am I okay with that?\r\n\r\nNo, I am not.  I want to be a good person, a thoughtful human caretaker of this planet, but I also want to drink convenient and relatively inexpensive filtered water.  Since I am not willing to give up drinking filtered water, are there other alternatives that will do less damage to the planet?  Yes, there are.  \r\n\r\nI can use these washable water bottles that I own, and buy fewer one-liter bottles (or none).  I can use reusable gallon containers (or larger) and refill them at Walmart, and stop buying disposable water bottles.  I can make a small difference, one mouthful of water at a time.  But I wonder about the other plastic bottles that I buy:  milk, ketchup, shampoo, laundry soap, hand soap.  For some products there are alternatives, yet for others\u2026I have no choice in the matter.  And, probably the biggest objection:  I am one of 325,000,000 people in the United States.  How much of an effect will I have on the national and global use and misuse of plastic?  I\u2019m not being nihilistic.  I\u2019m asking everyone to face reality.  It\u2019s a good question, one I need to continue thinking about, though I am afraid that we\u2019ve gone down a path that cannot be changed.  Clay jars gave way to metal, glass, paper, and now\u2014plastic.  What is the next material we\u2019ll change to?  I dunno."}]}, {"videoID": "02EJ1IdC6tE", "publishedAt": "2014-06-05T03:59:53.000Z", "title": "Want to sound like a leader?

The opposite of addiction is the lack of addiction. Connection in the aforementioned sense already assumes dependency which is the stepping stone for one with a proclivity for addiction to be pushed towards sheerly external reinforcement. And in terms of mental health, there's not much of a difference between being addicted to substances or to the unconditional support of your 'flesh and blood'. Sending such a superficial message about this issue is probably doing more harm than good... (But at least there was profit to be made from the expensive tickets.)"}, {"topLevelComment": "Johann. Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong. \n\nFirstly, addiction is often caused by an event that happened in somebodies past. So taking substances such as mind altering drugs is an effective way of not having to deal with the reality of what happened to them. \n\nSecondly, some people are more  susceptible to becoming addicts than others. Five people could try the same drug. One or two could become addicts, depending on what has happened to them during the course of their life, but also somebody could become an addict who has not suffered any kind of negative experience."}, {"topLevelComment": "I'm a Drug Addict and Everything he said is right"}, {"topLevelComment": "Lol cmon like it's hard to figure out why people are addicted?

Some people are chemically addicted to substances, some people are trying to find \"rat park\" in all the wrong places because inside they feel like noone would ever love them if they truely knew them or that they are basically a worthless person. Some people have trauma that runs so deep they just dont want to ever feel agian. One thing that is true is that the opposite of addiction is connection. The most successful treatment of addiction leaves you in the end working with other. For those of you that think you can just tell a family member that you love them and will give them what ever they need, that's not the kind of connection they need. They need someone just like them to be there for them every day. I am not saying to cut them off, love them even if you have to do it from far away, addicts will steal your stuff then help you look for it. My point of this ramble is that all situations are different and the answer is that someone is actually there when they ask for help."}, {"topLevelComment": "You seem like a great guy which I would love to have as a friend.

Addicts have a genetic predisposition to their disease and 10% of the troups that used heroin in Vietnam indeed continued to use on their return home and required a lot of help. I dont agree with most of what this guy says. After all, I dont know any humans that live in empty cages but they still become addicts."}, {"topLevelComment": "We are all addicted to something, or a process for better or worse. Even love and connection is just another addiction. The only reason we care if substance addicts get sober is because we feel hurt by them changing, our expectations are not being fulfilled. A personality has died, and has been replaced. We don\u2019t like the new person. Otherwise, they would be fine doing what they do until they decide they want to change again. They probably know reality better than sober people, and that\u2019s why they escape. Escaping in to love and connection is another illusion/addiction. This may be sufficient for some but for others it\u2019s not enough or it becomes boring.

A person can be an a crowded room and still feel disconnected. Just as they can have a large loving family and still feel disconnected. Disconnection is not the # of family and friends, it is the connection they FEEL with those family and friends. There can be a myriad of reasons an addict feels isolated and disconnected from the people in their lives.Low self-worth, shame etc. And it starts when a family member says \"My sister/brother/mother has lots of people who love them, they are not disconnected\" because that demonstrates a basic misunderstanding and inability to empathize. It perpetuates the disconnection when a family member announces that because THEY think the connection is there, then it must be. Because THEY feel or think something then it must be valid. That is the opposite of empathy.

In his \"happy rat cage\" (our new marriage and a clean life) he lasted a little over a year before he began to use excessively and by a year and a half was not himself and was on a huge downward spiral and ended up in rehab.  \nIt is possible to stay clean for a limited period of time because you have connection, but without actively pursuing recovery, you're going to hit that drugged-up water eventually.

Alcohol is one of the most illegal drugs, and \u201elegal heroin\u201c aka opioids is prescribed to people like kanye, \u201elegal meth\u201c aka aderall is used to improve student efficiency. \n\n2. victim culture saying \u201eslavery is a choice\u201c is wrong obviously but modern slavery is real and I think its a first world problem that actually matters, but most people don\u2019t act apon it, they just play the victim (what they are but it won\u2019t get them anywhere) it\u2019s like feminism or playing the race card \n\n3 trying love and it sounds so stupid because we are taught that this just doesn\u2019t work but honestly i think people are 99% more likely to recognize the negative things about someone/-thing before even considering anything positive about it.
