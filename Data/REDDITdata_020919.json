Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n>I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mom8)\n>What's the recipe for the White House's beer?\n\nAnswer:\n>It will be out soon!

We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmg8)\n>What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?\n\nAnswer:\n>The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm2v)\n>What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?\n\nAnswer:\n>Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60ml11)\n>How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014?\n\nAnswer:\n>We've really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm5n)\n>Who's your favourite Basketball player?\n\nAnswer:\n>Jordan - I'm a Bulls guy.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mlwx)\n>We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?\n\nAnswer:\n>Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm41)\n>Are you considering increasing funds to the space program?\n\nAnswer:\n>Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmaf)\n>How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?\n\nAnswer:\n>It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner.

Where the missing money went is a mystery that continues to fascinate students of England\u2019s underworld.\n\nNow documents within Mossack Fonseca\u2019s files reveal that the law firm and its co-founder, J\u00fcrgen Mossack, may have helped the conspirators keep the spoils out of the hands of authorities by protecting a company tied to Gordon Parry, a London wheeler-dealer who laundered money for the Brink\u2019s-Mat plotters.\n\n On Feb. 10, 2011, an anonymous company in the British Virgin Islands named Sandalwood Continental Ltd. loaned $200 million to an equally shadowy firm based in Cyprus called Horwich Trading Ltd.\n\nThe following day, Sandalwood assigned the rights to collect payments on the loan - including interest - to Ove Financial Corp., a mysterious company in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nFor those rights, Ove paid $1.\n\nBut the money trail didn\u2019t end there.\n\nThe same day, Ove reassigned its rights to collect on the loan to a Panama company called International Media Overseas.\n\nIt too paid $1.\n\nIn the space of 24 hours the loan had, on paper, traversed three countries, two banks and four companies, making the money all but untraceable in the process.\n\nFamily members of at least eight current or former members of China\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee, the country\u2019s main ruling body, have offshore companies arranged though Mossack Fonseca. They include President Xi\u2019s brother-in-law, who set up two British Virgin Islands companies in 2009.\n\nThe leaked files show the firm regularly offered to backdate documents to help its clients gain advantage in their financial affairs. It was so common that in 2007 an email exchange shows firm employees talking about establishing a price structure - clients would pay $8.75 for each month farther back in time that a corporate document would be backdated.\n\nThe world\u2019s best soccer player, Lionel Messi, is also found in the documents.

Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can \"spend\" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.\n\n*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons!

Reddit is popular because it's popular, and for no other reason.\n\nI don't mean to be negative, but seriously...this was planned.

"}, {"body": "Well, now who is reddit going to scapegoat with all of their angst?"}, {"body": "Welcome back, Steve.\n\nWhile I doubt we'll ever find out exactly what changes were a direct command from Ellen, the one that I found most curious was demanding all employees move to San Francisco. To me, one of the successes of reddit was how all of these amazingly talented people from across the globe could work together without HAVING to be together. With a global reach for staffing, you're able to have the best team possible, but by demanding geographics, you're limiting yourself to whose willing to move/deal with the cost of living in San Francisco, etc.\n\nI understand that face-to-face working/meeting is different than virtual, but where I work, because of geography, we simply can't be all be in the same place, and that's just the reality of it. There is no way to congregate everyone. We trust everyone to perform their roles, have a reporting process and meet regularly through teleconference and video conference.\n\nWhen reddit announced/commanded that everyone must move to San Francisco to remain employed I saw that as the end to reddit as it was. Even if everybody moved, you'd have a lot of people who didn't want to and were leaving their homes/families/lives. Having happy employees is more important than a punch clock/physical presence, especially for a virtual company. Yes, there are SOME jobs that should be physically together (the physical servers of reddit are somewhere, so theoretically someone who needs to be switch things on and off needs to be near them), but reddit functions 24/7, so having people spread across the globe/time zones would benefit the operation.\n\nI know this isn't an AMA, but I'm curious whether you, Steve, are going to step back and evaluate all of reddit and consider making big moves that may look like going backwards, because that worked.\n\nI also appreciate that we don't/can't know why /u/chooter was terminated, but if the rumours of her disagreeing with the changes of her role are the root cause, I would hope that you'd be open enough to consider that someone whose been in the role should be listened to for their opinions. I'm not suggesting you hire /u/chooter back, but if the reason for her termination was a disagreement with someone who has now stepped down as CEO, it would mean a lot to the users if /u/chooter was given the option to return - let her decide. If I was Victoria, I'd consider it, but I'd be wanting a firm personal employment contract that protects me from termination without severance unless I was stealing from the company or something. You pay people to be good at what they do and think/contribute, not to be drones and do what you say. If you want drones, fire everyone and outsource overseas.\n\nAnother voice seemingly lost in all of this is /u/kickme444 who brought such positive energy and commitment to the reddit userbase. Truly, the reason I created my account and stopped lurking was to be part of the first Secret Santa. If you check the age of my account, you'll see it was created within days of the first Secret Santa campaign, run out of Dan's home, for free, all to bring some joy to the world. Again, I doubt we'll know why Dan was terminated, but seeing that reddit killed the store connected to redditgifts, which presumably was a source of income, I can only guess that reddit Inc. was cutting ties with anybody who didn't agree 100% with what they were being told to do. Same as my comment above - Dan was hired and redditgifts bought from him to contribute to the community/organization/company, so if he was terminated for having opinions on what he created, reddit is the loser in the situation. Dan will have no trouble finding another job, but the chaos reddit created in his life by forcing a move and terminating him is disgraceful.

She couldn't possibly have made those changes herself and have nobody disagree with it. Reddit is getting commercialized, or at least, changing how they are getting their money. And that's okay. Better communication would have been nice.\n\nEllen Pao stepping down now will change nothing, unless the board miraculously un-fires the people who have been let go, reinstates banned subreddits and members. However, since nothing in the announcement nor comments points to this being a possibility, it's very likely that the changes Pao took flak for will just stay there.\n\nFrom a business and strategy perspective, this has been a great move, lots of people bought it and jumped on the hate bandwagon, but they completely lost track of the real thing happening here, and that's the structure of reddit being changed.\n\nI'm not opposing this. I'm just in for the smaller subreddits which have an awesome community and a website has got to find ways to survive, and it can't just forever lean on karma and reddit gold. The way it happened just doesn't seem like fair play at all. But that's all gut feeling.

He was a leader who aimed to bring us one step closer to universal health care, and even though we haven't reached that goal yet, he's made a big step. President Obama has been, in my humble opinion, the greatest President in American history.\n\nAnd now we have Trump coming in, as sort of an anti-Obama, threatening everything we've accomplished.

We are in an age of **instant gratification** and on the terms of immediacy (i.e., blinding fast results). For example, cell phones, fast internet connection, hell - even ordering something online and getting it the next day! Based on American History and past presidential administrations; change can happen **ONLY** within the matter of **YEARS** and not days/months. The man was handed a mountainous task of creating a universal healthcare system, so to make sure everyone is well taken care of. He was tasked into taking on multiple problems to a country conditioned already into a state of fukt-uppedness (I just made that word up), considering all of the cultural changes we were going through in a 21st century. He was also handed a fucked up economy that was tail-spinning into a deep recession, thanks to our former administration. THANKS, W!!!! So don't give me that shit about, \"Obama is a big spender....\". That's horseshit in a chef's salad. Yes the deficit shot up during his administration. Yes....because it was already fucking high as a motherfucking kite when he got there. He did what no other president has done before. He was the one person that truly tried to solve or at least address every issue that the public had voiced.\n\nTo conclude my rant, my sum-up of the shitstorm election and results we had.... I can only look to the future with absolute uncertainty (Hell, at least with George W. Bush, I had some certainty of where we're going). The masses have spoken. It tells me that we have one foot in the grave with this clown taking office. The people he has considered adding to his cabinet are racists and complete fucking idiots... I'm not joking. You'd get better results with my 7 year old cousin. I really do think we are turning into the people that are portrayed in the movie [Idiocracy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/).\n\nAll I want to do is move out to the middle of fucking-nowhere, so I can be left the fuck alone.

Unfortunately, they got separated - Aizik was supposedly taken away to a concentration camp. She made her way to a refugee camp in Italy, and eventually to New York to start over.\n\nOver years, decades, she became a successful professional woman in New York. One day she was riding the subway, reading a newspaper, when she and a man across the aisle looked up at the same time and locked eyes. The man was Aizik -- my great uncle Aizik. \n\nAmerica is the reason my family survived the Holocaust back then -- every single one of them.

Morocco is over 99% Muslim, and Islam is the state religion. \n\nThe people there welcomed me with open arms. In my town, I could not leave the house without people inviting me in for tea, bread with jam, dates, or a full meal. Sometimes people would literally drag me into their homes to show hospitality. Why? They saw I was a foreign woman and the way that they lived their faith was to be welcoming and hospitable. Their act of inviting me in, of feeding me, of showing me love, of truly accepting me as I was, for who I was? To them, it was literally an act of worship. \n\nI have dozens of stories-- the time I lost my wristlet (with money, passport, phone, etc.) and when I called the phone, the taxi driver who found it drove it out to where I was, took me to where he found the wristlet, then offered to drive me anywhere I wanted. He asked for nothing in return. \n\nOr the time that I stopped in a small village on a long-distance bus, and an old man grabbed my hand, intertwined his fingers with mine, and said \"Morocco and the U.S. are like brothers. We are close. Like this. You are like our family.\" \n\nThe way I was adopted into certain families. The way that my neighbors who had so little resources that they didn't have a bathroom in their house still sent their daughter over with a pot of tea and stuffed bread when I came back from traveling... they knew I probably was tired and wanted to rest, but wanted to be sure I was taken care of without having to prep food and cook. \n\nI moved to Rabat-- the capital-- after Peace Corps. While there, I met the man who is now my husband. A Muslim, Moroccan, wonderful man. He is the opposite of what many think a \"Muslim man\" must be like. We respect each other. He treats me like an equal partner in everything. We laugh together every day, and after five years of marriage, I am more and more in love with him. \n\nHe teaches me to be a better person. When we first got married, he showed me that settling disagreements with raised voices and hurtful words isn't how you treat a loved one. He helped me settle down with my temper. And even now, if he sees it starting to flare, he'll de-escalate me with a joke or by making light of the situation. He helps me remember what is important in life-- people, actions, simple things... not a good job, having a good image, or impressing others. \n\nMy heart is breaking. I am calling, I am writing, I am marching. But my heart is breaking. He came halfway across the world to be with me, and now, my country is such the opposite of the hospitality, love, acceptance, and welcome that I received in Morocco.

She joined the PTA, ran the elementary school newsletter, drove us to and from school and extracurricular activities, made every meal, took care of the house, the pets, made tons of friends, was known in the community as someone who would step in when there was a need that needed to be met. \n\nShe contributed in every possible way that a citizen could, but she kept her Spanish and Venezuelan dual citizenship (she was born in Spain and moved to Venezuela as a child to escape Franco, that's a whole other story), because she was aware that the American Dream was not guaranteed. She always said she'd become a citizen if Hillary ever ran for president though. She was very aware and invested in American politics, which was why it scared her to see how quickly and terribly things could change for Americans, citizens and immigrants alike, and why she kept her foreign citizenships.\n\nShe was one \"tough cookie\" (she loved that American saying). She passed away when I was 15 but she lives in me, my brother, my half brother, her sister and brother in law, their kids (all of whom are now American citizens from Venezuela and have jobs and houses and businesses, or are American students), and all the people she touched.

Which would be an *amazing* career boost and really help out science in the USA as well... *but* he happens to be Iranian in addition to Dutch, because his father is, so he can't come give his invited talk.  This is so fucking awful on so many levels.\n\nMy own family's immigrant story because you asked: I am a first generation American, born from Hungarian parents.  My father was born in a refugee camp in Austria after WW2- his first crib was a flour crate, my grandfather with two PhDs worked in a rock quarry for pennies, and they got sponsored to Canada when my dad was 3.  At the time the USA also discriminated against nationalities for immigration- my family was on the \"losing side\" of WW2 so were not allowed entry even though they were against the war, of course.  But my father moved to the USA with his family in high school the year the law was changed (my grandfather immediately got university teaching jobs until he died), and my dad started a small business that provided for many Americans many times over the initial investment.\n\nMy mom came over in the 1980s, as a defector from communism, and married my father.  So basically turning her back on her home, at the time with no idea on when she'd ever return.  She ultimately got a graduate degree in education and raised some pretty awesome children who are productive citizens (if I may say so), and we are all proud to be Americans.\n\nIt makes me so sad now to know that there is right now the equivalent of my father as a Syrian kid out there right now, for whom once again the door is closed.\n\nEdit: a lot of people are saying my colleague should just enter on his second passport. Well guys, when you apply to come to the USA they ask you to list *all* your nationalities and said visa is typically good for a few years (for European ETSA stuff at least). Not sure when my colleague applied, but when he did he did not want to break the law and was truthful on his application about multiple citizenships. And now he's supposed to fly out next week, but no airline would dream of flying him because he would likely be turned back at the border because of info in his visa that he's also Iranian. \n\nThis is one of literally thousands of stories out there.

My mother is a full-blooded Filipino who immigrated to the U.S. as the nanny of a U.S. Navy family who were based in the Philippines for a year.  Her mother (my grandmother) told her to go with them as it was a wonderful opportunity to immigrate to the country that is \"America,\" especially because the family offered to bring her in the first place and everything would be taken care of.  She ended up in San Francisco with this family at 22 years old in the Eighties.  Talk about culture shock.  After another year of caring for this amazing family's two young children and getting used to the States, the family moved to another base in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nIt's here that she met the crazy Navy guy that is now my father.  He was 21 at the time and my mother would have been 23.  The family ended up not needing my mom as a nanny any longer a few months after moving to Virginia, so she had a choice: remain in Virginia with no family and few friends, or go back home to her family's farm a few miles south of Manila.  Well, with some help from my dad, she decided to stay!  Fast forward a few years into the early Nineties, my dad is out of the Navy, my mom and dad are married, and my older brother is on the way.  That's my mother's story of immigration. Super sweet and simple, and everything worked out.  My father's side of the family? Their story's a little darker:\n\nLet's rewind back to the late 1930's in rural Germany, somewhere between Cologne and Koblenz.  Some of you already know where this is going.  My great grandfather and my great grandmother are young and have just started seeing each other.  They're preparing to marry, meanwhile Hitler's in power and the National Socialist Party, unanimously known as the Nazi Party, is accelerating at mach speed.  It's 1936 and things are already hitting the fan and no one in this tiny village wants to enlist into the \"bigot's army,\" so my great grandparents and my great great grandparents decide, \"screw this, we've got to get out of here, we're going to 'America.'\"  After THREE years of hard work on TWO neighboring, tiny, smelly farms, my great grandparents and their parents saved up enough money to send just my great grandparents to the U.S. on ONE big, smelly boat of hundreds of people from all over Europe, a lot of them Jewish.\n\nSo it's 1939 but Nazi Germany hasn't invaded Poland yet.  However, during this voyage across the Atlantic to New York's Ellis Island the invasion did take place.  Because of this, upon arrival, my great grandparents had a difficult time getting through.  My grandmother told me her parents were there for three days, but there are no Ellis Island records of that (at least from what we've found online).  We only have when they were let through: some time in October of 1939, on one condition.  They had to be married for my great grandmother to go through, so they were sent to a farm in Kansas on a train so my great grandfather could work and they had to get married within a month and sent proof of it back to New York.  Luckily they did get married and were allowed to stay in the U.S. For the sake of time and effort I'll leave it at that, but unfortunately I had to leave out a lot of tragic detail.  Another time, I suppose.\n\n**Edit**: After re-reading this, you can totally tell the last paragraph is rushed.

No black people in the region, hardly any black people in the whole country. \n\nIn  some towns there were Moroccans, sometimes Roma people too. Not in my hometown. Expensive housing, tons of summer-only inhabitants, typical coastal, tourism-oriented little town. \n\nAnd 20 years ago, black men arrived here. They stood out like a sore thumb: tall, young, athletic, and obviously black. Many people regarded them with mistrust. \n\nThey didn't speak any of the local languages. But they wanted to work. So, as is traditional, they took the jobs the locals didn't want. They became fishermen, the ones that stay at sea for months on end. Really tough job that used to be the main source of income for the town, until tourism took over. The kind of job that young local people didn't want to get into. \n\nThese black men spent months at a time out at sea, fishing, with older local men. So, when ashore, they started interacting more and more. They started learning the languages too; at first they couldn't write in those languages, but they got really good at speaking them, because they learned them from constant exposure and repetition. \n\nSo, 15 years ago, you could see groups of fishermen having drinks; for every 4 white, older fishermen, there was one younger, black fisherman. And they spoke the same language, and they had each other's back. \n\nAnd then the black women came. I don't know how it happened, but it did: suddenly there were black women too, and those black women married those black men. I'm sure there could be some mixing too, but I left the town, so I don't know. \n\nNow there are black kids at the local high school. They speak the local languages and they are local, born and bred. They have the same rights and the same opportunities. And I'm so happy everything turned out right. Their parents had to fight tooth and nail for it, but it turned out right.\n\nAnd that's their story. \n"}, {"body": "People complaining that reddit is becoming too political seem to forget that the admins blacked out the entire site in protest of a specific bill being voted on in Congress.

My grandparents with an educational obtainment no greater than basic grade school, knew that if their three children (my father, aunt, and uncle) were to succeed in any aspects of life they would need an education. So, they lived in great modesty, only making sure the money they made went to give my father and his siblings the best school they could afford. His days and evenings were spent studying as he approached the end of high school, as only a small percentage of students got into the universities there. Thankfully he passed, and a friend of his suggested that my father attend university in America. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea, given the political climate in Tehran. The year was 1977, and a world away Star Wars was introducing America to a galactic empire of fear and tyranny, but there in Tehran, tensions were to a breaking point under the ruthless dictatorship of the American-instilled Shah.  In the days when Tehran fell also birthed a new hope, my father managed to get a visa to America and decided to go and stay with some cousins in the Midwest. \n\nIn what was described to me as a scene out of an Indiana Jones movie, my dad made it onto a runway and had to climb up a rope ladder into a moving plane as military forces drove down the runway trying to prevent them leaving. It was the last time my dad would see my uncle. \n\nMy dad settled in Gary, Indiana. Young and inspired, but speaking very little English, he worked three jobs while applying to schools. He got into M.I.T. but unfortunately couldn\u2019t afford it \u2013and so he settled with Indiana State. He played soccer, made friends, assimilated, and met my mom.

And sometime after graduation my grandparents finally told my father that his uncle was no longer with them.\n\nYou see, my grandparents, despite working very hard to provide for their children, only had enough money to send one of their kids to America for college. My uncle, being the middle child, was unable to follow my father immediately after him. So he did as every young person does, work and talk politics. \n\nAnd so it goes, the small talk that turns to politics with a neighbor leads to him being taken from his home in the night, and not heard from until his name was discovered a few weeks later amongst the many who were executed for dissent. Those same neighbors were the ones who reported him, ironically going against the famous doctrine that tells us to love thy neighbor.\n\nIt broke my father when my grandparents explained that three months prior to graduation, my uncle was murdered by a new theocratic dictatorship. Religious extremists who, like so many dictators and fascist movements, purged any and everything that dared challenge or contradict their own legitimacy and power.\n\nBut my father has been, and will always be, a resilient man. After graduation, my parents went back to New York for some time, trying to get work in New York City, my father got denied a position in The World Trade Center which could have only been attributed to the current Iranian Hostage Crisis taking place \u2013a blessing in disguise. Eventually, they moved West \u2013 all the way to California. My father became an aeronautical engineer with a small firm with lofty ambitions, to change the way flight recording was being handled. My father contributed to the safety of our nation\u2019s air force by helping design some of the flight recorders in our fighter jets. I still have pictures of him sitting in cockpits, and many memories of us lying in a field identifying planes and jets that flew overhead and through the clouds.

His English was ok, with him having had a good education in Germany, but the INS still gave him a little bit of a hard time when they insisted on making absolutely sure he wasn't just marrying for a green card. 25ish years later he's still not a citizen, and he doesn't worry for himself about being turned back at the border, but the U.S. is his home now, and he always trusts his green card will let him come home after he leaves the country. It's disturbing to see that security rattled for other people.\n\nSorry, I said it was going to be an upbeat comment. My parents are both doing well for themselves, having stood on their parents' shoulders a bit but ultimately carven out more for their kids than they had. It happens all over the world, but the U.S. has always been a symbol to me of that mentality and that hope. I'm hopeful that people will in the end regain sight of that and stop this nonsense.\n\nAnd congrats to my girlfriend on getting her U.S. passport today!"}, {"body": "My parents are both Iranian.

My grandmother grew up a Navy brat moving from base to base. At 18 she knew she wanted a different life than the one she'd seen her mother lead as a housewife with an absent husband and with few options open to her at the time. So, in 1957 when she met a young man from Colombia who was studying in the United States she fell in love with him and the dream of a life somewhere different, and married him and moved to Colombia not long after her 18th birthday.\n\nLife in Colombia was different, but also somewhat the same. Although her husband loved  her and initially supported her and tried to help her build the life she had dreamed of, being a woman there meant many of the same sacrifices as it had back at home. Her in-laws were pleased that their son had a young *white* wife and saw her primarily as a trophy, who would produce light skinned children who would let their family take the place in society that they felt their hard work and small fortune entiteled them to. It became clear that working, raising her children without nannies and servants, associating with people of different cultures, and being the only woman in her husbands life were all things that were off-limits to her. Eventually, much to the shame of her inlaws, she began living with her children in an apartment in the city and remained only nominally married. As much as she wanted to make her marriage work, her husband's ideas of marriage didnt involve fidelity or equality; he supported her and their children financially and loved them in the ways he knew how, but couldn't stand up to his parents or his own ideas of the role of women in society.\n\nEventually she decided that she needed to return to the states, where she could raise her children with the loving support of her parents and siblings. American law at the time created a technicality that prevented young women married to foreign nationals from passing on their citizenship, so her children were only Colombian citizens. In order to get passports for her children, she needed her husbands signature, something he refused to do, because he suspected that she was going to leave permanently, shaming him and his family. She contacted the American embassy in Colombia and they came up with a plan to help her. Her sister in the US sent a letter explaining that their mother was sick and didnt have long to live. My grandmother shared the letter with her husband and inlaws and told them that she and the children needed to go to the US to be with her family, but this didn't convince them, and they refused to let the children leave. So for months, she told everyone in their social circles about her mother's illness, and never went out in public without rubbing soap in her eyes so everyone thought she'd been crying. After a few months, the embassy sent a faked telegraph to the home of her inlaws saying that her mother was dead. Now that everyone in their social circles knew that my grandmother's mother had been sick, her inlaws couldn't reasonably refuse to let her and her six children travel to America to go to the funeral. My grandfather agreed, and my 10 year old father and his five siblings recieved passports and visas to visit the US.\n\nSadly my grandmother was unable to bring one of her children with her, a young woman whose mother had been employed by my grandfather's family and had died in childbirth, becoming a ward of the family. My grandmother had watched her grow up, taught her to read, and thought of her as her own daughter, even though her husband and in-laws refused to let the girl live in the house with my grandmother, and she was cared for by all of the family's servants communally.\n\nWhen she reached the states, my grandmother sent her husband a telegram letting him know the reality of the situation. He never came after her, and sent her small amounts of money from time to time. She told me she thought he always knew she was leaving for good, and never really wanted to cause her any sadness, he was just too weak to stand up to his parent's expectations of him.\n \nMy grandmother began working for the Catholic church in Maryland as something like a social worker, but she and her children didnt fit in. She had left her husband and was ostracized by the wives and nuns in the local churches, her children were beaten in school for not speaking english, and my father, her eldest, was placed in classes for children with down syndrome because of his status as a english language learner. She rapidly distanced herself from the church, and eventually found a home for herself and her children among Mexican families in another state.\n\nAbout a year after she brought the chldren to the US, immigration services figured out that the children had overstayed their visas. Again, she found someone sympathetic; I don't know all the details of this part of the story, but somehow they were allowed to travel to Toronto and apply for citizenship as Canadians, rather than return home to Colombia to apply. My father's first green card said that he immigrated from Canada, and his youngest brother, who had been born six months before the trip to the states, was somehow registered as a natural-born citizen.\n\nMy grandmother raised those six children of quasi-legal status by herself, and even as a single mother with only a highschool education, she managed to support them until they were grown. She somehow ended up taking in other people's children constantly, when parents couldn't manage being parents for whatever reason, and today there are over 60 people who call her grandma, abuela, or 'great' (she says 'great-grandma' sounds like an old lady, but 'great' just sounds like an awesome lady). My father and his siblings ended up spending years living with their father in Colombia as young adults, and although that relationship will always be difficult, they love him and the children he had with the \"other women\". My dad can never be President because he isn't a natural born citizen, but something about his story has always felt uniquely American, and as someone who is technically a first generation American it breaks my heart to think that anyone could be excluded from this country for reasons as idiotic and those being advanced today."}, {"body": "Thanks for posting this Alexis.

My uncles' unit, the 442nd, suffered extreme losses, but they did it to prove they were American.  *No American should ever have to prove this*, but they did, and they make me extremely proud.  \n\nMy other grandfather came from nothing in Hungary, worked hard, and earned his MD in the US despite prejudice against Eastern Europeans.  He had to change last name because it was too \"foreign\" sounding for Americans to accept, but he succeeded and made sure his kids & grandkids had the tools to get an education too.  \n\nI followed in my great-uncles' and uncles' footsteps, joining the Army to defend my country; and I wouldn't be here if we hadn't become tolerant enough to decriminalize interracial relationships.

Now, both my mom and dad run a daycare that they opened 10 years ago at our house, and are able to live much more comfortably than what they could've imagined in El Salvador.

I look up from the T.V. and he said to me, \"hey osama-bin-sexy I know Steve Irwin is a big hero of yours and you love him, but I just heard on the news that he just died in Queensland.\" I kind of just looked at him for a second dumb struck. I was really sad obviously, but somehow I remember realizing that my dad was even sadder, because he had to tell his only son that his hero died.

For my cats. \n\nYou see, my grandmother likes to drink white wine while watching Wendy Williams each morning.  Occasionally, gets carried away and has one box too many. When that happens, she is often struck with the urge to fire off a few rounds at the broken down Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme in our backyard (excluding a vigorous case of gonorrhea, it was all that her third husband, Alfredo, left her in the divorce). I make sure to load her shotgun with buckshot so it doesn't go too far. Most damage it ever caused was when she tore up the Chinese Chestnut tree of our next door neighbor, Mr. Wu. Luckily, it wasn't a relation.  \n\nThe problem is, her drunken target practice usually coincides with our cats' late morning backyard squirrel hunt. Now, I know my grandmother would never intentionally target the two of them. However, the fur of both Bustopher Jones and Mister Mistoffoflees happens to blend in quite well with the garbage heaps that accent our backyard. Their fur, when working in tandem with my grandmother's cataracts, render them virtually invisible to the nude eye.  \n\nThe cats seem to know to stay away from the Oldsmobile. Probably has to do with the stench that Nana and her gentleman friends leave behind (it's therapeutic for her to make love in the very object that serves as a constant reminder of Alfredo's betrayal; also, I don't have to air the house out after everytime she bangs some time rando).  \n\nBut when Nana is hopped up on chardonnay to the point of grabbing her shotgun, she's generally not seeing one Oldsmobile; she's seeing three. I've told her to aim for the middle one, sure, but she's old and easily confused. One of her legs is seven inches shorter than than the other, as well, which messes up her aim on a good day (although it makes her am amazing tap dancer). It's not uncommon for her to miss the car entirely and hit the outhouse or the birdbath or the stop sign I stole the last time I took peyote or one of the couches or the other birdbath instead. All are prime squirrel hunting areas, so naturally I'm afraid Nana will wing one of the cats. \n\nIf I had a couple of these flak jackets, though, I wouldn't have to worry so much. Even if the buckshot hit their heads. They are so ridiculously inbred, their skulls are mostly empty anyway.

I worked on the film \"Death to Smoochy\" as a lowly PA, and I had never before and have never since seen someone on set like Robin Williams.  He never turned off.  After DeVito yelled \"cut\" Robin Williams would still go with his manic improv.  It was a lot of fun being on that set on days when Robin Williams was shooting.  He had a non-stop engine/drive to entertain.  Really fun stuff.\n\nWe were filming in Times Square the day of Super Bowl XXXV (when the Ravens killed my G-men), and after we wrapped for the day, the production had rented a floor of ESPN Sportszone, and the whole cast & crew went over there to watch the game.  \n\nOf course, the crew had started a pool for the game, and everyone bought a box or two - actors included.  DeVito won the first quarter.  Edward Norton had the halftime box.  And (if I remember correctly) Robin Williams won both the 3rd quarter and final score (I think the score had the same last digits at end of 3rd and end of game, right?).\n\nOf course, we lowly crew shrugged our shoulders when the multi-millionaire actors won every.single.box.  \n\nBut to Robin Williams credit, he took the money from that and then some and bought the crew gifts at wrap.  It wasn't much.....just a stupid \"Death to Smoochy\" hat, but it was a nice gesture.  I've heard stories of actors buying the entire crew gifts before, but - other than this example - I had never seen it once in the 5 years I spent working in film production.\n\nAnyway, I felt like sharing this somewhere, so I thought I'd leave it here. I will forever remember Robin Williams energy both when the cameras were rolling but especially when they weren't, and I will always remember his generosity to the crew.\n\n\nSide story - a couple years later I was working on another film, and we were shooting in Central Park.  Who rides by on his racing bike in full biker gear - hat, racing glasses, skin tight pants, etc. - than Robin Williams.  He hops off the bike and says hello to some of the cast members and the director, and he was still the same exact guy he was a few years earlier.  Just so funny to see him in spandex and tinted sunglasses running around a set doing his improv.

FUCK"}, {"body": "I've seen a lot of people ask how the Supreme Court has the authority to decide this issue for states. For those interested, I am an American lawyer and I can answer that question with some insight.\n\nYes, the Supreme Court does have the authority to make sweeping decisions that invalidate any and all state laws which conflict with its ruling. The Supreme Court finds this authority in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and from the very significant court case of *Marybury vs. Madison* which more or less established the Supreme Court's absolute authority to literally \"say what the law is.\"\n\nStates do have autonomy to decide certain issues for themselves. These are judicial notions of 'comity' and 'parity,' the idea that state governments are better equipped to deal with local and regional issues rather than a distant Congress in Washington. In fact, the laws of contracts traditionally belong to states, which is why every state in the U.S. has slight legal differences in how contracts are formed, enforced, written, etc. Marriage, in its most basic legal form, is a contract entered into by two consenting adults, which is why marriage laws have been decided by state legislatures and state courts.\n\nBut there's an important amendment to the U.S. Constitution that (as of today) strips away the right of a state to define marriage in their laws as a union between one man and one woman: the Fourteenth Amendment (and more specifically the Equal Protection Clause) which states:\n\n> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \nWithout getting too much into the nuances of the Supreme Court's varying standards of review (although I certainly can if you're interested), the Supreme Court traditionally reviews Equal Protection issues under what's called a 'rational basis review.' It is the most permissive standard the Court can adopt--that is, it is the least difficult standard to meet in order to successfully defend a law from being struck down. The review asks whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. With respect to the issue of marriage equality, the question is: Are state laws banning same-sex marriage rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the institution of marriage?\n\nTo that question the Supreme Court has apparently said 'no.' The fact that the Supreme Court today could not find any rational basis for these state bans related to the stated goal of protecting the institution of marriage says *a lot*. The Court is literally saying there is no rational relationship between banning same-sex marriage and protecting marriage. Thus, same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and every such law in the United States is immediately invalidated.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made sweeping judgments like this before, although decisions of this magnitude are quite rare. For examples, see *Brown vs. Board of Education* (which held that state laws enacting racial segregation were unconstitutional) and *Loving vs. Virginia* (which held that state laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional).\n\nTL;DR: Yes, the Supreme Court has the authority to say what the law is for the entire nation. Yes, marriage is traditionally an area kept to state law, but only up to a limit until a law runs headlong into the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\n**Important Edit:** It appears I've disseminated some amount of disinformation for which I apologize (I did not get around to actually reading the full opinion until now). As pointed out to me by /u/Armonster20, the Supreme Court **DID NOT** review this case under rational basis. Rather, it was decided under a strict scrutiny review. The majority opinion does not even make much mention at all of the words \"sexual orientation,\" instead focusing on the fundamental right of marriage. A lot of you have asked about the varying standards of review, but I must confess that constitutional law is outside my usual day-to-day practice and I'm doing the best I can to remember the basics I learned in law school. I could try to explain the standards of review in detail but I'm afraid of saying something inaccurate. The least I can do is direct you **[here](http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2014/01/challenging-laws-3-levels-of-scrutiny-explained.html)**.\n\nBut to go into just a little more detail, the strict scrutiny test is the most demanding standard of review to which the Supreme Court can subject a law. The reason the Supreme Court chose to review this case under this very exacting test is quite logical actually: the Supreme Court has previously said that any law that abridges a \"fundamental right\" must meet the most demanding scrutiny, and the Supreme Court has previously deemed the right to marry as a fundamental right. Thus, because any state law that excludes an entire class of people from participating in marriage obviously implicates the fundamental right to marry, we get strict scrutiny. (FYI - Another fundamental right under the Constitution is the right to have an abortion.)\n\nWhat this means is that the majority made it damn-near impossible for the respondents (i.e., the states defending their same-sex marriage bans) to win in this case. What this does NOT mean is that any future LGBT issues will be given the same standard review, unless they of course deal with marriage. Most likely, any future litigation on LGBT issues will be subject to rational basis review or something that's informally been called \"rational basis review with a bite\"--a standard somewhere between normal rational basis and intermediate scrutiny."}, {"body": "That's it, my wife and I are getting a divorce."}, {"body": "Opinion [here](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf) (pdf)."}, {"body": "This is destroying the sanctity of Bristol Palin's marriage.\n\nEDIT: more gold pls"}, {"body": "RIP pastor in texas who said he would light himself on fire when this day came.."}, {"body": "Finally, 50 states of gay!"}, {"body": "The final two paragraphs of the Court's opinion:\n\n> No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies\nthe highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,\nand family.

The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.  When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution\u2019s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed\n\n> * Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. \n\n> * No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization\u2019s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\n\n**Highlights from the Roberts Dissent**\n\n> * When decisions are reached through democratic means, some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results. But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are\u2014in the tradition of our political culture\u2014reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate. ... But today the Court puts a stop to all that. By deciding this question under the Constitution, the Court removes it from the realm of democratic decision. There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound public significance. Closing debate tends to close minds. People denied a voice are less likely to accept the ruling of a court on an issue that does not seem to be the sort of thing courts usually decide.\n\n> * If you are among the many Americans\u2014of whatever sexual orientation\u2014who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today\u2019s decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.\n\n**Highlights from the Scalia Dissent**\n\n> * This is a naked judicial claim to legislative\u2014indeed, super-legislative\u2014power; a claim fundamentally at odds with our system of government.\n\n> * But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today\u2019s judicial Putsch.\n\n> * If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \"The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\" I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\n\n**Highlights from the Alito Dissent**\n\n> * By imposing its own views on the entire country, the majority facilitates the marginalization of the many Americans who have traditional ideas. Recalling the harsh treatment of gays and lesbians in the past, some may think that turn-about is fair play. But if that sentiment prevails, the Nation will experience bitter and lasting wounds.\n\n**Highlights from the Thomas Dissent**\n\n> * (LOL, not worth including)"}, {"body": "Being a divorce lawyer just got twice as lucrative."}, {"body": "My parents emigrated to this country to give us a better life.

He has told me he doesn't feel like he's special for serving but I told him that the way he feels when he thanks another soldier/vet is how people feel about him. He is humble...I suppose thats a good word. I stand there watching him and I can't even begin to tell you how proud I was. He got up, waved, smiled, and said thank you but had to keep his head down because he was really emotional. I mean the whole area of people were shaking his hand, clapping, yelling, and the lady was just yelling and cheering over the intercom. It meant SO much to him and means SO much to me when stuff like this happens to him because it ALWAYS reassures me that I made the best decision being with him. Not that I doubt him, its just amazing to always have that reassurance. I've lived my life with mostly mistakes and bad decisions, but I can look at him and know that I made one really great one which makes the mistakes and bad decisions somehow okay. It makes me happy when people do this because I know that it means a lot to him and to see him receive those things......I just love him and it makes me so proud. \n\nI'm sorry if that was long or redundant or boring.

The pride they feel when you are patient enough to really show them how to do their jobs well and they do it is infectious. My boys knew that their boss was there for them. If they did a good job for me, I made sure to do the same for them. Even if they slipped, popped a piss test or something, if they did a good job for me, their boss was there.

Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:.....and now trump lol\n\n 1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\n 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n 3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\n 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n 5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\n\n 6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n 7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n 9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n 10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\n 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\n\n 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n 14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control election \n\n"}, {"body": "So when exactly do we, as citizens, draw the line? This is getting completely insane.

I know how to drive in snow. I moved away when I was 25. I've lived here 7 years and there are TONS of Northern transplants down in Raleigh. Inexperience isn't really the problem here.\n\nSnow in Raleigh is not the same as snow in the north. I remember this day fondly. Because Raleigh only gets snow once or twice as year, and it usually melts away within a day or so, the city (and state overall) doesn't really bother investing in plows and/or salt. They lay down a salt brine a day before, which usually washes away when the first bit of snow lands in a semi-liquid form.\n\nWhen the snow falls, it usually starts as freezing rain (as it did in this picture) which turns everything into an ice skating rink. Then snow lands on TOP of that ice, making it look like fluffy snow. It's not. It's solid ice under it.\n\nThe scene right here was taken at a MAJOR state highway, Glenwood Avenue. The hill was essentially solid ice. There was no traction for anyone. The snow fell really fast, and we don't really have plows (they'll sometimes slap a plow on a city pickup truck for major roads but half the time, they aren't even 4WD). The car on fire caught on fire because it started to slide back down the hill due to its slick nature, floored it to prevent itself from sliding all the way back, blew a gasket, sprayed oil on the hot engine, and it ignited. \n\nI knew this shit was coming, so I worked from home because my employer is cool like that. My wife, on the other hand, was working in a medical outpatient facility an hour west of the city and she left the second she saw a snowflake. She was stuck in the mess you see here for 4 and a half hours. \n\nEDIT: For those saying \"Why didn't you just stay home?\". The significance of this storm was unexpected. We expected a few flakes and got an ice rink instead. Snow started falling around 1:30pm while everyone was already out and working. This picture was taken at like 3 or 4pm. The people on the road were scrambling to get home.

I won't give the south crap for not being able to deal with rare weather."}, {"body": "As a long-time resident of the state, allow me to explain a few things to the people who continue to say variations of \"How could this happen?\"\n\nThe picture that you see (Glenwood Avenue in Raleigh) was after a storm that had a number of awful coincidental features. It started in the middle of the day. Although the weather people said it was going to start some time during the day, they weren't sure when, and that was only when it was going to start; even those of us used to the weather here figured we had time to get home after that. In our defense, these things usually DON'T start in the middle of the day, we usually get them at night.\n\nI was working in Durham at the time, 20 miles WNW of Raleigh. When we saw the precip start outside our window, we finished up the particular task we had, packed up the laptops, and headed out. I lived 9 miles from work.\n\nIn 15-20 mins from the start of precip, the roads were sheets of ice. Skill would help you keep out of the worst of trouble, but there was too much trouble to avoid it all. The slightest incline was enough to make your car slide, and there isn't a lot of flat ground here.\n\nSince there was no good warning, the roads were crowded. After one car slides, the next one has to try to go around it, and slides to a different place. Every stoplight on a hill, every curve next to an intersection that had the slightest bank, cars started accumulating.\n\nGlenwood Avenue, in the picture, has several long steep hills, people are used to 55-60 mph on it, and yes, people will drive too fast on slick surfaces. But any speed was too fast on that surface, not due to any stupidity on the part of the drivers, but due to the weather conditions and the timing. I gave up 2.5 miles from home, where there was a shopping center to park in, and walked home from there. Only fell once.\n\nWe do pretreat roads. We do plow roads, but we have limited equipment for doing it for the same reason that people here don't buy snow blowers much -- it just isn't worth it because we get snow too seldom. When we get 'snow' here, it is *usually* along with freezing rain and/or sleet, and that's very difficult to plow. And nobody can drive safely on ice. \n\nAnd we don't generally have to here. When we get any significant snowfall -- an inch can be enough -- we shut down schools and a lot of work and mostly stay home, because it is going to melt in a few days. This is another significant difference from the folks up north: it is going to go away, so why bother plowing everything carefully? \n\nOne other thing to keep in mind -- snowfall here is usually in temperatures around freezing. Mostly the highs go above freezing during the day and back below it at night, so it melts the top of whatever there is and then freezes it again. Again, nobody can drive on that.\n\nSo all you folks with all the jokes and comments about how stupid we are: I guess you feel superior, and certainly we have our share of bozos. But I don't think we have any more than our share, and the fact that you don't understand how this could happen says more about you than about the people in the picture."}, {"body": "[deleted]"}, {"body": "As someone who has lived in the deep south for many years, but now lives in Western NY I have seen both ends of the spectrum. In their defense they don't have the equipment to deal with snow and the type of snow that falls down there is completely different. The type of snow you always get in the south is heavy, wet and turns into hard ice very quickly. The type of snow you generally get up north is powdery and doesn't turn into hard ice very quickly if at all. So just in the kind of snow you get it is very very different conditions. Combine that with a complete lack of equipment to deal with it and you have a pretty obvious recipe for problems.\n\nThat said, people down there do earn their stupid reputations for driving in it. I've watched more people trying to drive 50+ mph with rain tires acting completely oblivious to the fact that they are driving on ice. Sorry but if you do that, then you deserve to be laughed at. Anytime I am down there in the winter visiting and it snows, I borrow my bother in laws small all wheel drive car and go around offering to tow the big jacked up pickup trucks out of the ditch.

That means while it is what we get most of the time that doesn't imply only. Obviously region can play a big role. I'm up near the lakes and that is what we get most of the time and have for the past 5 years. Where as I grew up in the south and never once in my life saw the \"powder\" we get up here.

Then, the temperature dropped so fast the water accumulated froze again and snow fell on top of this. What you are looking at in the picture is a layer of pure ice with a dusting of snow on top. So, looks were deceiving. The weather officials didn't see this happening and schools and businesses closed a little too late. I was a teacher at the time and it was a nightmare. Second, our cities are not prepared at all for this type of winter weather. We don't have snow plows, salt trucks, and the like because we never need them. It would be a waste of municipal funds.

I can't claim to have ever lived in a northern state that gets a lot of snow, but this is how I imagine it to be.\n\nIn North Carolina, it snows, the first bit hits the ground, and melts, then, that afternoon, all that water freezes solid, and creates a nice surface for all the snow to stick to. Then, the next day, the snow partially melts, and freezes solid overnight. \n\nWe don't get snow in NC. We get ice. Even when it snows, it's not nice, fluffy snow.

Anybody who knows me knows #CarrieFisher was my first love. I thrilled to the adventures of #princessleia in the @starwars movies, but from '77 to '84, I was in love with Carrie Fisher herself. My bedroom was filled with Carrie Fisher pictures from any movie she was ever in (including Polaroids I took off the TV when #thebluesbrothers hit cable). I was jealous of Paul Simon when he was dating Carrie Fisher and wouldn't listen to his music until they split up. I paid to see Carrie Fisher and #chevychase in Under the Rainbow nine times when it was in theaters (mostly because Carrie Fisher was in underwear in one scene). In childhood, I committed myself to Carrie Fisher without ever meeting her the way novice Nuns commit themselves to Christ without meeting Him. Decades later, I got to tell her this when Carrie Fisher and @jaymewes were in a station wagon on the set of #jayandsilentbobstrikeback. She was gracious about hearing it for the zillionth time from the zillionth man or woman who grew up idolizing her, but wickedly added \"I'm glad to know I helped you find your light saber.\" And with that, she stopped being Carrie Fisher to me and just became Carrie. That's the Carrie I'll always remember: the dutiful standard-bearer of childhood dreams with a the wicked sense of humor and a way with words. She didn't want to get paid for her role in @jayandsilentbob Strike Back; instead, she asked that we buy her these antique beaver chairs. Her reason: \"Beaver seems an appropriate currency for this movie.\" When she was a guest on Season 1 of our @hulu show #Spoilers, Carrie curled up in the throne like she belonged there. And she did: after all, she was royalty. As a boy, I dreamed of marrying Carrie Fisher. As a young filmmaker, I dreamed of casting Carrie Fisher. As an adult, I dreamed of being as sharp-witted and prepossessed as Carrie Fisher. And now that Carrie Fisher is gone, I'll dream of my friend Carrie - whose entire magnificent career I was lucky enough to witness, whose honesty made me a better person, and whose spirit - like The Force - will be with us always.

The problem is the system itself.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served in the U.S. Navy for 5 years and during that time frame I've seen a lot of people come and go because of underage drinking, adultery, drugs, and bad behavior. One thing that I've seen only once was due to mental health.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure if this only applies to the fast attack submarine force but this is why suicides happen. Note: fast attack submarines only had men on board during the time I served.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that you you're feeling down recently and no matter what you do you can't seem to shrug off this underwelming feeling seems to be taking over your life. You're not eating much anymore, you're beginning to drink alcohol excessively, and you're beginning to demonstrate poor performance at work by constantly showing up late or half assing your job. Eventually you think that you might be depresssed. You go to the doctor of your submarine (which is not an actual doctor that went to medical school but instead a person who is taught to handle more simple issues like cuts and distributing antibiotics) which is a corpmen. He tells you that you're just feeling down and that you shouldn't worry about it and the feeling will go away. You trust the doc since he's the most knowledgeable person on board and you just wait it out.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks go by and you realize that the feeling of being alone just isn't going away. You tell Doc again and he gives you the same answer. This time you decide that it will be best if you go to Mental Health and see an actual doc because you know this empty feeling is more than just a phase. You eventually go to mental health and talk to a doctor that wants to see you three times a week to talk about your issue. You are actively seeking help so although you feel like its impossible to shake away this feeling, you are still doing something to try and make things better. But it doesnt get better, because you get back to the boat.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment you get back to the boat and you tell the Doc that you went to Mental Health, everything changes. Doc gets upset at you for going to see a doctor outside of him. He eventually tell's the chief of the boat (think of an executive position of a company but in charge of enlisted personnel) and eventually the rest of the chiefs (divisional supervisors) hear about it too. One would assume that they would be supportive of your action, but they arent. They are the complete opposite. They are beginning to look at you funny, they are making off handed negative remarks about you, and some of them even goes up to you and ask if you're just faking it to get off the submarine. These are your supervisors, the people that you are supposed to look up to for guidance and now they are looking at you like you're the worst person to ever step foot on the submarine. \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the alienation doesn't end there. Word gets out to the rest of your crew members (E6 and below/ other team members) and they begin to verbally harass you. They start calling you a bitch because they think you are just trying to scam out of work, they start laughing at you while you walk by because a person can't be mentally weak while in a submarine, they start putting you down in front of the rest of the crew because you are now the odd person out. These are the guys that you work with every single day of your enlisted career. These are the same guys that you went on a deployment for months at a time underwater without seeing sunlight or constant email from loved ones. These are the same guys that you would party with when you pull into port and the same guys you would cry to when your girlfriend cheats on you while youre on deployment. These are your family. \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, your loneliest exasperated because the people that you once trusted so much are ostracizing you because they think you are lazy and just trying to get off of work. What do you do now? You see these guys every day for work while in port and are stuck with them 24 hours a day while deployed. You're constantly around a culture that puts you down every second of everyday. You're not only feeling alone, you are completely alone. \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So one day, you're standing watch at 1 A.M. with one other person in port. You looked down at your holster and stare at your 9MM pistol. You start feeling like life no longer has meaning and that you have no one, you have nothing to live for, and no one will care if you are gone. You pick up the 9MM pistol, turn the barrel until it's facing you, and you pull the trigger.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having more suicide prevention seminars will not stop the problem, we need to stop the culture that demonizes a person who is seeking help.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the link to the most recent submarine sailor that took his own life.

It makes me sick that we have all of this bullshit being made out to be \"news\" and our country ignores these numbers. After what just happened to my family, his shipmates, and his friends I made a promise to myself and to him to make this issue known and do something about it. I'm at the airport right now about to fly to Connecticut to attend a service with his ship and view his body. So when I logged on to Reddit and saw this at the very top I shed a tear. This conversation needs to be had in more forums so that we can give these men and women the support that they need. It's not just a mental health issue, it is a military issue. The stigma around depression needs to be changed. We have young men that are going straight to military life without ever being away from home, and they do not have the support they need. The guys fear talking to anyone as that conversation could make them unfit for deployment and at times their job. There has to be a non military party involved in helping these soldiers out. My youngest brother just graduated from Basic in the Army today and I am so afraid now. I made him promise to speak to someone, even if it's not me, anytime he has depression that lingers or suicidal thoughts.

They're nation wide accredited programs, provided by LivingWorks, that teach participants to recognize when someone may have thoughts of suicide and work with them to create a plan that will support their immediate safety. (Depending on which workshop you take)  \n\n\nIn ASIST you learn to actually provide intervention and in SafeTALK you learn to discover warning signs and keep the person with thoughts of suicide safe and get them to a resource (trained professional) to help.    \n\n\nI myself am a trained ASIST member, but also recently became a provisional trainer for the SafeTALK course.   \n\n\nWhat I've learned is invaluable. It only took 2 days to learn ASIST and SafeTALK can be taught in a 3-4 hour lecture.

No one is going to do it for you. I got out in 2009, but even back then the message from command is clear: do not seek help from us. We'd have briefings about suicide damn near every week, but each time there was an implied message: we're doing this because we have to, and if you can't keep your shit together enough to get back behind your weapon, you're a pussy. Well, fuck those guys; their objective is to get as much as they can out of you, and if you want your life back, you have to *take* it back yourself. If you're still in, start climbing your chain of command asking for help until you fucking get it. Do not take no for an answer. They owe you this. You signed their contract and you held up your end of the bargain, now it's their turn. If you're out, get to the VA or your local Vet Center and ask for help, and don't leave until you get it. Look for private therapists through your insurance and start churning through counselors until you find one that can help you. You can make your life better. Think of it as a mission, if it helps. Write it out as an OPORD if you have to. You could potentially have given your life for some bullshit mission ordered by your command that would have ultimately accomplished nothing in the wars we've been fighting, but you never would have just walked up and let yourself get killed without putting up a fight. \n\nIf you think you don't deserve it because of what you had to do, well, maybe you're right. That's how I felt for a long time. The thing is, you can earn your life back retroactively. No matter what, you can make your life a net positive and have a positive impact on the world.

Is that helping them, or would it be better to apologise to them for the shit we put them through? I'm asking, because what I can say for sure is that a hugely disproportionate amount of homeless people and people with certain medical conditions in the UK are war veterans, and the MoD certainly does not give them a life pension or even much specialist healthcare (the NHS is NOT equipped for the unique circumstances of war)."}, {"body": "I really hate this.

I was in for 10 years and never once did I see someone get kicked out for being honest with a counselor or seeking help for issues involving PTSD (unless they had a debilitating illness).

I maintained a professional and courteous demeanor even though my inner-ten year old was geeking out knowing I was helping Princess Leia find a copy of 'My Dinner With Andre' or some other obscure art-house movie. \n\nSo one day a fellow employee and I were taking a quick smoke-break outside and Ms. Fisher happened to be inside. He was having a harder time maintaining his composure and exclaimed to me, \"Can you believe Princess fucking Leia is in the store right now?!!!\" He did this just as she was leaving the store and walking past us. In fact, Ms. Fisher and I had a long moment of eye-contact. She had a very knowing and flattered smile on her face while I just gave her a goofy little smirk and pointed at him with subtle rolling eyes. \"Have a good afternoon Ms. Fisher\" I said as the other employee turned beet-red with embarrassment. \"You too boys,\" she replied. \"And you should quit smoking those things - they'll kill ya.\" \n\nSo that's my Carrie Fisher story.

For myself, and an entire generation of boys, it was so important that the woman we all fell in love with growing up was so much more than a pretty face. Yes, she could somehow make an earmuff hairdo work. But she was also smart as hell, a take-charge badass who was fearless in the face of danger and unwaveringly devoted to doing the right thing. When her boyfriend got kidnapped, she lead the effort to rescue him...and when some gross dude tried to make her his slave, she literally choked him to death. Being in love with Leia meant that a lot of us learned to look for a smart, capable woman who was every bit the equal of the men around her, years before we'd learn words like \"feminism.\" (She was also the reason that a LOT of little sisters, including my own, got invited to play in their brothers' Star Wars games).\n\n\nAs I got older, I gained a greater appreciation for how much Carrie had to overcome in her personal life, and how smart and funny she actually was. She was hilarious in Blues Brothers, Austin Powers, and 30 Rock. She was a hugely talented writer (fun fact: she was one of the top script doctors in Hollywood throughout the 90's, and helped write a load of popular films including Hook and the Wedding Singer). Most importantly, she was totally unafraid to be herself in an industry that relentlessly pushes women to conform. Even if she had never been Leia, she would have left an impressive legacy behind.\n\n\nThis has been a rough year in all sorts of ways, but losing Carrie has been one of the toughest blows of all.

Furthermore, people who have HSV-1 and HSV-2 are over 3x as likely to contract HIV. Currently, the regulatory nature of the FDA has created such high barriers to entry that only the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical players would be able to push through a vaccine (the approval process costs 100+M). However, with a 4B+ annual market in a drug called Valtrex (which only handles outbreaks but does not prevent transmission), the large players are not incentivized to create a cure or vaccine for HSV-1/HSV-2. Instead, they have been pushing subunit vaccines (viruses that are so heavily attenuated that the body is unable to produce a long lasting immune response; these failed trials centered around the same failed approach maintain their profits in drugs that keep those who suffer at bay rather than giving them a lifelong solution). Billions of people carry HSV-1/HSV-2 and tens of millions suffer from lifelong outbreaks. \n\nThe company that the therapeutic/preventative vaccine is being tested under is called Rational Vaccines. They have recently conducted Phase 1 trials internationally and have seen profound results in the mitigation of symptoms in people with extreme cases of HSV-2.\n\nUltimately, a live attenuated HIV vaccine will likely be the path to eradication of the disease. This was the method employed for the polio and chickenpox vaccines. However, the attenuation of the polio, smallpox, chickenpox vaccines was random rather than by design, making it risky if the virus reverted to its original form..this resulted in the infection of 1 in ~100,000 vaccine recipients, but this was because the virus was attenuated in one site and would, in rare case, mutate back to its oringal Wild type form. My father's approach attenuates the HSV-1/HSV-2 viruses in multiple locations while still leaving it 99.7% intact. Since it is attenuated in multiple locations the odds of the virus reverting to its dangerous form are 1 in 100,000^3, meaning that practically no one who received his vaccine would be infected. The risk pales in comparison to the millions of people who contract HSV-1 and HSV-2 every year.\n\nSo Bill, is there a way that you could look into my father's work and help guide progress in the clinical trials/approval of the vaccine? Your foundation has the potential to make that impact.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"}, {"body": "Hi Bill.

Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:.....and now trump lol\n\n 1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\n 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n 3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\n 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n 5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\n\n 6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n 7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n 9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n 10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\n 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\n\n 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n 14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control election \n\n\n"}]}, {"id": "5v9ixj", "title": "I said, \"How tall are you?\" He handed me this:", "ups": 102533, "score": 102533, "created_utc": 1487650749.0, "num_comments": 3612, "comments": [{"body": "HAHA NOW STAND THERE WHILE I TAKE THIS PICTURE."}, {"body": "His face!

Moonites are top right, to the left of Squidward. At that magnification the image is fuzzy, so my estimates of measurement will be off a bit.\n\nA single window pane is roughly 27 inches x 27 inches. The Post It notes are 3 inches x 3 inches. That means it takes 81 Post It notes to fill one window. I counted roughly 197 windows covered in notes. \n\n81 npw (note per window) x 197 windows = 15,957 notes. \n\nMulti-color packs come in pads of 90 notes per color at roughly $1.70 per pad. \n\n15,957 notes would mean 177.3 pads. \n\n177.3 pads x $1.70 = $301.41\n\nEDIT: changed the wording on some measurements and changed to acknowledge that the Post Its were donated by 3M. \n\nEdit: Mooninites, not Moonites.\n"}, {"body": "I work in this office that took the picture!

There are 90 notes in a single pad, so we can estimate 1.07 pads for each window.\n\nNow, the windows have differing amounts of coverage, so I made the following matrix estimating the amount of coverage in each bank of 24 windows (7 banks across and 6 banks down)\n\n. | A | B | C | D | E | F | G\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nA | 0% | 0% | 4% | 25% | 6% | 33% | 25%\nB | 33% | 75% | 100% | 100% | 92% | 83% | 0%\nC | 100% | 92% | 8% | 71% | 33% | 25% | 0%\nD | 50% | 0% | 25% | 92% | 25% | 0% | 0%\nE | 0% | 0% | 0% | 8% | 88% | 83% | 8%\nF | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 4% | 67% | 8%\n\nSo, If we multiply each banks percentage by 24 windows we get the following matrix:\n\n. | A | B | C | D | E | F | G\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nA | 0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 1.5 | 8 | 6\nB | 8 | 18 | 24 | 24 | 22 | 20 | 0\nC | 24 | 22 | 2 | 17 | 8 | 6 | 0\nD | 12 | 0 | 6 | 22 | 6 | 0 | 0\nE | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 21 | 20 | 2\nF | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 16 | 2\n\nAdding all of these together, we get 327.5 windows.\n\nMultiply that by 1.07 pads per window gives us just over 350 pads.\n\nThe pricing is inexplicably different for each color, but we are averaging, so I will use $2.25 per pad (The average of each price listed on Amazon YMMV)\n\nThat gives us a total cost of approximately $786.53\n\nThe stack of notes is 1.9 inches for 5 pads giving us 133.16 inches.\n\nStacked into a cube, it would be 9\" x 9\" x 14.8\"\n\nNo where near a pallet, but still quite a lot of post-it notes.\n"}, {"body": "****UNIT CALCULATION****  \nHorizontal Post-its per pane -  \t13  \nVertical Post-its per pane - \t7  \nPost-its per full pane - \t91    \n\n.  \n.  \n\n**YELLOW**\n\nTotal Full panes\t75  \nTotal almost-full panes\t12  \nTotal almost empty panes\t16    \nTotal nearly half panes\t14  \n\n*Equivalent Count*  \nTotal Full panes\t75  \nTotal almost-full panes\t0  \nTotal almost empty panes\t15.2  \nTotal nearly half panes\t7  \n\nTotal Yellow post-its (full panes * post-its per full pane) - 8845.2  \n\n\n  \n  .  \n.  \n\n\n  \n**BLUE & PINK**  \nTotal Full panes\t30  \nTotal almost-full panes\t14  \nTotal almost empty panes\t4  \nTotal nearly half panes\t8  \n\n\n*Equivalent Count*  \nTotal Full panes\t30  \nTotal almost-full panes\t0  \nTotal almost empty panes\t6  \nTotal nearly half panes\t4  \nEquivalent full panes\t40  \nTotal Blue & Pink post-its (full panes * post-its per full pane)\t3640  \n  \nConsidering there are 100 post-its in a normal pack, thats about 125 packs which isn't much money for a lot of publicity for 3M\n.  \n.  \n.  \n\n**Total Post-its\t\t12485.2**\n  \nSource for Units calculation: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CiXVP1-UkAAjACt.jpg:large  \nSource for Panes calculation: http://i.imgur.com/RycdbMO.jpg\n\n\n\n"}, {"body": "For all those asking, \"don't they work.\"\nIt's an advertising agency and this is an exercise in creativity ... it gets the creative juices flowing.

Which is not good at all, Deutsche bank, like Lehman Brother's, took on a bunch of toxic derivatives and is on the brink of collapse. On top of all that Merkel has refused time and time again she will not bail them out if they declare bankruptcy. A major shift in liquidity heading back into US banks will surely spur a collapse. (Interestingly enough Trump owes Deutsche bank 300 million, he has a personal incentive to see them fail.)\n\nClimate aside the political elite in the EU know that, Paris deal or not, a Trump presidency will hurt them. This isn't on top of the fact that Trump seriously want's to increase EU spending on defense and essentially want's to pull out of NATO, or at the very least reduce the US's role. All these reason's are ultimately why Putin loves Trump also, Putin benefits the most from a weakened EU. \n\nThis is the EU telling the President-Elect that they have some political leverage to fight back.

State Street plans to send a letter to 3,500 companies on Tuesday asking the companies to act.\n\n>State Street is a huge player in the index fund world, managing about 90% of its assets in passive funds, which are often investing in companies held in the Russell 3000 and FTSE.\n\n>The money manager has cited gender diversity as a way to improve company performance and increase shareholder value. The lack of women on boards has long been a problem. Beyond pipeline issues, some boards see no reason to increase their gender diversity, data shows.\n\n>For State Street, the statue was a way to draw attention to the problem. Currently, nearly a quarter of boards represented in the Russell 3000 have no women at all, Heinel said, citing Institutional Shareholder Services data.\n\n>\"One of the most iconic images on Wall Street is the charging bull. So the idea of having a female sort of stand against the bull or stand up to the bull just struck us as a very clever but also creative and engaging way to make that statement,\" Heinel said. \"Even though it's a little girl, her stance is one of determination, forwardness, and being willing to challenge and take on the status quo.\" "}, {"body": "This is a promotional piece for an epic new anime, BullxGirlxWar."}, {"body": "That little girl gonna get killed.

The little girl and her plaque get get removed as vandalism for all I care. \n\nEDIT*: a lot of people are expressing disdain for me not supporting the idea of women equality in the work force, however that is not what my comment was targeted at. I support equality in the workplace, but it's the means of this artistic expression that are ruining its own integrity of the statement that is being made. \n\nLet's analyze this from an artistic side. You have the Wall Street bull a larger than life icon of power and unstoppable might. An expression for the force of Industry. And now you place a statue of a small girl in front of it. This is a terrible way to express the desired statement of women equality. Most women in a professional industry do not see themselves as small little girls who stand in front of giant uncontrollable beasts. \n\nWhy is it a little girl statue? Shouldn't it be a statue of a heroic strong woman staring down the beast ready to take the bull by the horns. Think Wonder Woman. But no they chose a fragile small little girl to get their point across. Only an inexperience child regardless of gender would be foolish enough to stand in front of a train and expect anything other than to be hit. It's a blind ignorance that the statue does not accurately portray a powerful adult woman, the same woman who are fighting for equality. \n\nAnd lastly this statue is a leech. It cannot stand without the Wall Street bull in front of it. It takes away the meaning and statement of the original bull sculpture to tack on its own agenda. It would be the same as if they stapled a flyer to the Mona Lisa and and claimed is as an artistic statement. No it's just vandalism of an already icon piece of art. If you were to remove the bull and just left the small girl statue it would literally not mean anything. And the plaque is the last nail in the coffin. If you artwork needs to have a disclaimer then you did not achieve the message you were aiming for. If you can not trust the audience to view your artwork and make their own connections then you have failed. This plaque changes the entire meaning of what could have been a nice art piece. When you go into a gallery the small cars next to the painting isn't there to tell you how to feel, the artwork on its own does that. \n\nThis is nothing more than blatant corporate marketing. I believe in equality but this shallow and lackluster display is hurting not only the original Bulls message but distorting the message of the very thing it's trying to support. Because I don't think there is a single woman in a professional industry who sees them selves as small girl about to be trampled but the rampaging juggernaut of industry.

We were just fast enough so we could elude it while still getting a thrill out of it. \nNow this didn't bode well for my younger siblings who were not fast enough to elude the damn bird. Once, when my city-slicker cousins came to visit my younger brother, who was probably 6 at the time was going to the coup to collect the eggs with our 3 year old cousin. My cousin was outside the coup and as my brother exited the coup the devil rooster appeared around the corner. \nInstinct took over and my brother quickly locked himself in the coup. Meanwhile, my younger cousin was quite enjoying himself and came around the corner and locked eyes with the dinosaur.\nNote that as a 3 year old he wasn't much taller than the rooster. They stared each other down, from probably 5 yards away. Then, channeling his inner Dr. Grant my brother yelled at my cousin from inside the coup \"Tommy, don't run!\" The moment got the better of Tommy and he took off at a dead sprint. It was the most beautiful form a three year old has ever had running, long even strides, while pumping his arms as he ran, fists to eye-level. It wasn't enough, the rooster gained on him and began pecking his butt over and over again. Tommy's mother heard his screams and came to his rescue, fighting the rooster off with a stick.

My mom and dad owned their house and there was a detached garage that had been converted to a barn to house a few horses that my neighbor owned. My parents had bought the house from the neighbor, and they always wanted to live on a farm so they were cool with the horses. \n\nBut with the horses came some other animals, namely, chickens and a rooster. Now the chickens were pretty nice, as chickens can be, but the rooster was a real ass. My parents had a dog that liked to wander the neighborhood and pick fights with just about everything, but not this little bastard. The rooster would chase him around all over the property and wouldn't rest until he nipped him a few times. This rooster (he never had a name, he never deserved one) would chase after my mom and dad, who'd generally give him a swift kick and that would be that. \n\nBut one day, while I was outside playing with my Tonka trucks while my dad worked on his real truck, the rooster decided he'd had enough of my sass (N.B. I was 5) and he was going to show me who's boss. He did, and I ran away screaming and crying cause the mean bird hurt me. My dad got good and pissed off, and in his rage chucked a massive socket wrench in the rooster's direction, hoping it would scare him off. \n\nThe wrench flew threw the air, and as if it had been thrown by the Mighty Thor himself, struck this bastard bird square in the head and knocked him out cold. My dad couldn't believe his luck, and decided to act on the blessing he had been given to finally get rid of the bird. Now, my dad has a heart of gold, and couldn't just straight up murder the little bastard, so he decided to pack the bird up in a box with some holes in it, and drove him about 10 miles out of town. He dumped the bird, box and all, into the woods near the road and figured that was that.\n\nThree days later, my other neighbor came home from work and told my dad about the rooster he saw walking down the main highway in town. Sure enough, later that day, the bastard came waltzing right back onto the property as if nothing had ever happened.

I thought that news articles saying that is what the DOJ was arguing were just hyperbole.  Nope, the DOJ argued that.  Think about that for a minute.  That could mean that the president can give executive orders having to do with national security and take away people's rights and it is unreviewable by the courts.  You know why that doesn't sound right?  Because no case ever has held that!  In fact, it is the opposite.  Courts routinely do this type of review.  While the president gets deference on national security (and a good chunk of it), there is always judicial review. It goes against our very notion of separation of powers to argue otherwise.  I would never make that argument.  I suspect that they felt that they had to make it because they knew that if the order was reviewed it would be struck down because it was written so broadly.  \n\nAlso, think about this, an injunctive relief was upheld despite the fact that the president gets so much deference.  The bar for injunctive relief is generally very high (although roles were a bit reversed for this decision) AND the president gets deference and he still lost.  \n\nThey also argued at one point that \"aliens\" don't have due process rights.

If an internal issue can trigger trump so much what will be his reaction in case of a national disaster? what he will do in united nation assembly meeting? "}, {"body": "Great comment by u/pxalt from this same story on r/news.\n\nQuick thoughts as I go through the [opinion](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3457898/2-9-17-9th-Circuit-Order.pdf):\n\n- The most important thing for everybody to keep in mind is that the court is **NOT** making a final determination as to whether Trump's Executive Order is legal. The court is determining whether the lower district court's order blocking the EO should be stayed *temporarily* while the district court makes its actual decision. To decide, the court considers four factors:\n\n> 1. Whether the people asking for the stay of the district court's order have a decent chance of succeeding on the legal merits,\n> 2. Whether the people asking for the stay will be seriously harmed if the stay is denied,\n> 3. Whether granting the stay will harm anybody, and\n> 4. Where the public interest lies.\n\n**Factor #1:** the court rules that the federal government failed to prove that it could succeed on the merits, because the Executive Order fails to provide due process (such as notice and a hearing) for people like LPRs (green card holders) and people with lawful visas whose travel has now been restricted. The court notes that right now the government has the burden, and they've failed to meet it (in other words: The federal government had to convince the court that they *could* ultimately win on the legal merits. The plaintiffs didn't have to convince the court that the federal government *couldn't*.) This is important, because it means that the federal government had a harder job than the plaintiffs. It doesn't mean that the federal government can *never* win on the merits, just that they didn't win today.\n\nThe government argued that the Green Card issue is no big deal, because White House counsel clarified that the order won't apply to LPRs. But the court isn't buying it -- White House lawyers can't overrule the plain language of the Executive Order, so what they have to say about the EO after the fact is irrelevant. Plus, the White House has changed its mind a bunch of times on what the EO means, so we're not going to judge it based on what they happen to be saying about it today.\n\n**The court punts on religious discrimination**: The question is whether the Executive Order amounts to religious discrimination based on President Trump's previous comments regarding a \"Muslim ban.\" Trump surrogates have argued that the court should consider only the language within the four corners of the Executive Order, and shouldn't consider extraneous information like what Trump and Giuliani have said elsewhere. The court at least isn't having that. \"It is well established that **evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered** in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims.\" But then...the court backs off. \"In light of the sensitive interests involved, the pace of the current emergency proceedings, and our conclusion that the Government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim, we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed.\"\n\n**Factor #2:** \"The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\"\n\n**Factor #3:** \"the States have offered ample evidence that if the Executive Order were reinstated even temporarily, it would substantially injure the States and multiple other parties interested in the proceeding.\" University students and employees were harmed, families were separated, residents of Washington and Minnesota (the suing states) were stranded abroad. Good enough for the court.\n\n**Factor #4:** The public interest favors both sides, but based on the prior factors we've made our decision. Appeal denied.\n\n**Other thoughts:**\n\n- The government says that if the court *is* going to enforce the stay, they should only enforce it as to people who are/were lawfully in the country and want to go somewhere else and come back. The court says no. Even people who are *illegally* in the country have constitutional due process rights. We're not going to forget about them.\n\n- The court takes particular offense to the government's claim that decisions made by the President concerning immigration are \"unreviewable\" by the judiciary. The court counters that such a claim has no legal precedent, and \"runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.\"\n\n- The court agrees that the judiciary traditionally \"counsels deference\" to the Executive branch in matters of national security. However, \"authority and expertise in [such] matters do not automatically trump the Court\u2019s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to\nindividuals.\" I'd love to say that the choice of the word \"trump\" was intentional, but the court was citing a SCOTUS case from 2010. Still.\n\n- \"[N]ational defense\u2019 cannot be deemed an end in itself, justifying any exercise of legislative power designed to promote such a goal. . . . It would indeed be\nironic if, in the name of national defense, we would sanction the subversion of one of those liberties . . . which makes the defense of the Nation worthwhile.\" The court here citing *United States v. Robel*, (1967).\n\nNote that while I am a lawyer, I am **not** a constitutional lawyer or an immigration lawyer.

The panel denied the stay per curiam, (EDIT: usually) meaning unanimously (EDIT: the actual definition is closer to \"acting unanimously,\" but practically speaking it means it was unsigned and therefore the opinion of the court as a whole, and not the opinion of any one judge). Each of the three judges on the panel was appointed by a different President - 2 Democrats, and 1 Republican.\n\n\n2. The Court found that the states of Washington and Minnesota had standing to sue because of the harm the Executive Order (\"EO\") does to its public universities and those students. Public education for the fucking win.\n\n\n3. The ruling is limited to the propriety of the District Court's temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") halting the EO, NOT the constitutionality of the EO itself. In my opinion this was a huge strategic error on part of the feds, because the analysis for TROs (and injunctions in general) is way different than the analysis of the substantive underlying issues.\n\n\n4. The feds argued that the President's decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are UNREVIEWABLE. The Court found, rightly, that the President does not and never has had any such unlimited right. (My opinion) This goes against the very tenets of our Constitution, namely separation of powers into co-equal branches, and checks and balances on those branches. Those are the types of things dictators say. But in America, \"[i]t is emphatically the duty and province of the judiciary to say what the law is.\" - Chief Justice Marshall, Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803).\n\n\n5. The essence of the holding is that the feds failed to meet the first two criteria for an emergency stay, i.e. whether 1) they have shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying issue, and 2) they will be irreparably harmed by the absence of the stay. In other words, the Court basically said \"you haven't proven that you would win, and it's not going to hurt you to wait until we sort this out.\"\n\n\n6. The feds argued NOT that the executive order properly allows for due process rights for those affected by it, but rather THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS. Again, that is what dictators say.\n\n\n7. The Court declined to modify the scope of the TRO. Meaning that it still applies nationwide to the EO. They write, \"even if the TRO might be overbroad in some respects, it is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order.\"\n\nEDIT: /u/conklech correctly pointed out my (misspelled) definition of per curiam was not entirely accurate."}, {"body": "I honestly had President Trump tweeting in all caps at least 6 months in.\n\n\nGotta love checks and balances."}, {"body": "<states opinion>"}, {"body": "[removed]"}, {"body": "Inb4 entertaining twitter rant..\n\"All opposing so-called courts are fake courts\""}, {"body": "I'm sure President Trump will take this news with the grace and humility he's known for."}, {"body": "No one's gonna see this, but I like tacos"}, {"body": "Any ban that doesn't include Saudi Arabia is meaningless."}, {"body": "[deleted]"}, {"body": " Individuals can still be denied entrance when there is a reason to deny them.

It becomes really hard for them to argue that these people who have already been vetted by the system, need to be banned out of the country until further notice despite not having any reason to be other than nationality.\n\nBut even if they can get past that argument-- intent is a huge part of this as well. While Trump and supporters claim the intent is to protect Americans from terrorism, comments made by Trump show the intent is a religious one. And we all know, that's also unconstitutional. This leads the judge(s) to the question: does comments outside of the EO show underlying malicious intent towards a specific religion or should we read the EO on surface value?

Right outside Watts hall, the Material Science Engineering building, where we had just been evacuated for a fire alarm. Everyone was standing around in the courtyard, waiting for the fireman to come back out and declare it clear. The firetrucks started to pull away, and seconds later I heard a tearing, grinding crash and a lot of screams. At first it seemed like an accident, like maybe someone had slammed on the accelerator instead of the gas, and the car had hopped the curb, hit a big concrete/brick garden planter and launched over, landing immobilized on the other side, closest to me. I was starting to move towards the car to see if everyone was ok, a couple of people I saw that got hit were sprawled on the ground around the car. He must have still been trying to go forwards, holding down on the gas pedal, because the engine was revving super high. Then, when I was only a couple feet away, the door flew open and the guy came out flailing, I didn't even see the knife at first, I just saw swinging and a whole bunch of motion. My friend and classmate was on the driver's side of the car, and i was more on the passenger side. He caught the brunt of the attack when the guy sprung out of the car, and got some pretty deep cuts on his hands and arms. As I write this, he was released about an hour or two ago from surgery, he's ok but has some messed up tendons and nerves. Some others had broken bones, and I think just one more stab wound which was pretty bad. I'm just so thankful no one was killed, these were my close friends and people I care about, and to be right in the thick of it, when no one knew what was happening or why, it was scary. I ran, and I ran fast. I still don't know if I should've stayed and fought, or tried to help, and part of me feels guilty. But before I knew it I was through the building and out on the other side. That's when I heard the gunshots, and I didn't slow down to find out anything more. Thank god the attacker was the only casualty, he deserves worse than he got. \n\nI know it is only speculation, but I have to believe it was a planned attack, in relation to the fire alarm. The fire evacuation plans are plastered in every hallway of that building, he would've known that everyone would be conveniently grouped right there, in a three-walled courtyard with no easy escape route. There was about 20-25 minutes between the fire alarm going off and the attack, more than enough time for him to sound the alarm and retreat back to his car across the street. As soon as those trucks pulled away, boom, it all happened.\n\nI guess writing this is kind of my therapy. I made it to one of the dorms about 1/4 mile away, where we were under lockdown for what was apparently about 2 hours. Coming out of it, it only felt as if about 20 minutes had passed, it was the weirdest feeling. Anyways, I guess I wanted to give my personal account of what happened, because I never thought that something like this would happen to me, and it was a little bit of a wake up.\n\nStay vigilant out there, the world is a crazy place.

The last day of training was intense and we were put in simulations of dangerous situations that we would have to fight our way out of. We were encouraged to use all of the power we had and fight until our attackers, aka volunteers from the OSU PD, were down. I basically got to elbow the hell out of Alan's face.

Two local guys have an open suitcase and are trying on pants, shirts, jackets, shoes.  It becomes obvious they found or stole that suitcase. \n\nA few days later, my Brazilian friend in another city sends me a picture of his car... And his wife's car. No wheels. A group broke into their apartment building in the middle of the night and stole all eight wheels/tires and the neighbors brand new motorcycle.

One senior citizen resisted and was stabbed below the eye, forehead and one other place (but lived as far as I know)\n\nLater on TV they showed two guys robbing a car from a lady that had just gotten home. Her husband went to see what's happening and they showed him a gun and he ran back in the house. Turns out the car was an automatic (99% of cars are standard manual transmission) which they'd never seen so they walked away. I later find out this was a relative of a friend of mine.  Got lucky didn't get shot and they didn't take the car. \n\nA lot of unemployment. A lot of airport construction.  Tough times in Brazil right now.  \n\n--\u2013------\nMore details.

You, because you're a corrupt fucking group, destroyed someone who could've beaten Trump. You gave the nomination to someone with a horribly shady past. Fuck you. Trump's victory is on you as well."}, {"body": "Listening to him made my wife cry.\n\nSome background. My wife is Korean and we live in Korea. She's not a US citizen and she can't vote in our elections. I'm a US expat living abroad indefinitely, mostly for professional reasons. All her life all she's known is political corruption. Most people don't realize what an ugly political history South Korea has and have only really started hearing about it with our current president. But it's always been bad, and in the modern era most young Koreans are either apathetic or cynical about government. That last part might sound familiar, but as a dual citizen with a deep-ish awareness of both countries histories, I find the Korean cynicism to be a lot more relatable than American cynicism.\n\nAnyway, before she married me she wasn't particularly more aware of American politics than any average non-American world citizen. This past election season has been the first since we married, so it was her first in-depth exposure to stuff. Some of it shocked her. We both marveled at how the media is full of shit in the same way for opposite reasons. In Korea the media is full of shit because much of it is government controlled. In America the media is full of shit because it is corporate controlled. So that's depressing.\n\nBut listening to Bernie was especially moving for her. I guess it was for all of us. I don't know why I'm sharing this through her perspective, because if you swapped me in it would be much the same. But, she never knew she could listen to a politician speak and feel their sincerity. She never thought she could trust a leader to have the best interest of the public at heart. This wasn't about policy. This wasn't about agreeing with him on this or that detail. Some things we agree with, some things not, some things one of us agreed and the other didn't. I mean, that's democracy. That's how it's supposed to be. That's not what was moving. What was moving was the sense of purity, of integrity. The overwhelming sense that this was a man who was acting on our behalf first rather than his own.\n\nMany of us have been laughed at for expressing that sentiment. We've been called naive. And maybe we are. I guess by nature it's impossible for the naive to realize that they are so. I can't think about the millions of Trump voters who believed that he had their best interest at heart and not stop to question myself and ask if I'm the same. But then I look at my wife, this woman who has, in my opinion, more right to be cynical than any of us, who I would never for a moment think of naive when it comes to politics, and I see her being moved to tears by this man's perceived sincerity. I can't know anything, but that reassures me of my belief that yes, he absolutely should have been president. Maybe not by the rules of democracy, or oligarchy, or whatever it is we have, Maybe not by votes. Whether or not things were tilted enough to effect the actual outcome or not is something else no one can say with certainty. But I feel with absolutely conviction that with respect to what would have been best for the country and the world, it should have been him. He would have done the most good. He would have lead on behalf of the forgotten. He would have sought to give aid to the downtrodden. By the values that our country was founded on, by the ideals of what democracy *aspires* to be, it should have been him. He would have gone down in history with the greatest, the Roosevelts, Lincoln, Washington. He would have been the greatest leader of the century.

Good work."}, {"body": "I am a leather supplier to the Furniture Industry. The term \"genuine Leather\" is not indicative of the type of leather being discussed. The article accurately explains different types of leather.\nGrade is a term used to describe the quality of hide being used for a specific product. An example is: hides with a bunch of scars and holes are considered low grades, while hides with a cleaner surface are considered high grade. Leather vernacular is commonly misused and a generic term like \"genuine leather\" can be used for 100% leather products but also for a product called Bonded Leather.\nThat is a Polyurethane top with leather \"sawdust\" glued to the back and sold on cheap leather furniture at retailers like Rooms to Go or Ashley. It is made up of (typically) less than 20% leather content and only on the back. The consumer never even touches actual leather when they sit on it. Bonded leather sofas are commonly sold as genuine leather. That is a sad, dirty little secret of the furniture business:("}, {"body": "Calling something 'genuine', is basically stating that this thing has no other redeemable qualities except for actually being what we claim it is."}, {"body": "English is not my first language. But over the years it seems that the English language is losing its meaning to commercial uses to trick people into buying shit"}, {"body": "Now I know why my leather shoes from sale went to shit after 3 weeks of using them."}, {"body": "the article states that only \"Full Grain\" leather will develop a \"Patina\" over time. That is not true, only leather that is not coloured will get a patina over time.\n\nUsually, that means tanned with natural tannins in natural plant oils. it is usually called veg tanned leather but it might not be vegetable oils. \n\nThe alternative is chrome tanned leather (actually \"Chrome Tanned\" leather is the norm and \"Veg Tanned\" leather is the alternative these days), using actual chrome in place of tannin. the oil which carries the tannin in vegetable tanning is replaced by pretty harmful chemicals. However chrome tanning is very versatile. the benefits of chrome tanning is the ability to richly colour the leather by infusing the leather with pigments, make it really soft and supple, and of course making it last longer. \n\nVeg tanning leather results in hard and rigid leather and even if veg tanned leather is coloured, it is usually just surface colouring and not as vibrant as chrome tanning. \n\nAny richly coloured leather that is advertised as veg tanned leather in a country with false advertising laws is probably semi veg tanned, which means they are veg tanned then chrome tanned for colour and other benefits.\n\n---\n\nAlso \"Full Grain\" or \"Top Grain\" just means the top surface of the skin in the leather, where you can see the skin texture lines of the animal, that is the \"Grain\" of the leather. Thinning the leather has nothing to do with the type of the leather. Even if the leather is thinned, as long as the surface of the leather is utilized, it is \"Full Grain\".\n\n> IMPORTANT ADD ON!!\n\n> I forgot about a kind of \"Finishing\" where the \"Grain\" lines are not there, They are called \"Glazed\" Leather but they are still \"Full Grain\" Leather. nothing is removed from this leather, the \"Grain\" is still there, but the texture lines have just been rubbed flat. these leather are glossy, but not reflective, they are smooth but not slick to the touch. \n\nLeather can be very thick, the older the animal, the bigger its size, the thicker the leather will be. For different applications, different thickness is needed. For instance, mens products usually feature thicker leather compared to womens products, but they can both use the same kind of leather. Not to mention animals within a species can be as varied as humans, some can have thicker skins then others, and even on one individual animal, some body parts have thicker skin compared to other body parts. Leather have to be thinned for the end product to feel uniform.\n\nThinning the leather is called splitting.\n\nBefore i continue, it should be mentioned that the \"Grain\" is the top of the leather, the bottom where it is kind of furry, can be considered the \"Flesh\" of the leather.\n\nthe \"Flesh\" is what makes up the furry texture characteristic of \"Suede\" leather. \n\nSplitting the leather means removing some, but not all, of the \"Flesh\" from the leather. This results in the the top, called the \"Full Grain\" leather, and the \"Split\" which is the bottom.\n\nIf you use the bottom, which you can, that makes it \"Split Suede\". If you flip the \"Full Grain\" leather upside down to reveal the remaining \"Flesh\" under the \"Grain\", that is true \"Suede\". you can guess which is pricier.\n\n\"Suede\" is not decidedly worst that \"Full Grain\" leather, it is just a different way of using leather. Although it is common to use leather with more imperfections in its \"Grain\" as true \"Suede\" because why would you want to waste nice looking \"Grain\" in \"Suede\"? i would say if you really want to strictly say \"Suede\" is ~~worst~~ worse leather than \"Full Grain\" it is only because of practical purposes, and only worst in the sense that \"Suede\" Leather's \"Grain\" looks worst than \"Full Grain\" Leather's \"Grain\"; For all intents and purposes, both can be just as durable.\n\n\"Split Suede\" though is considered worst that \"Suede\" as even from the same source of leather, the true \"Suede\" has a finer and more regular texture compared to the \"Split Suede\" as there is less of the \"Flesh\" remaining in \"Suede\" \n\nSome of you might be familiar with \"Nubuck\" and feel it is similar to \"Suede\" but they are very different. \"Suede\" is a kind of leather, \"Nubuck\" is a \"Finishing\" or a way to treat the leather. \"Nubuck\" is \"Full Grain\" leather where you take the leather, use the \"Grain\" as the top, and then sand it with something rough so it will be just a little bit furry. you can tell \"Nubuck\" from \"Suede\" by looking for the skin texture of the animal. In \"Nubuck\" you can still make out the \"Grain\" lines from the skin of the animal.\n\n---\n\nthere are other kinds of leather.\n\n\"Bonded\" Leather means taking leather scrap and compressing them together. sometimes, they are embossed with lines to emulate the \"Grain\" Lines. Think of chipboard wood; scrap wood soaked in resin, compressed together, and veneeered with fake wood grain. these are commonly used in places where it is not visible as a form of structural support. Undeniably, they are bad leather but they do have valid and important uses, even in luxury products.\n\n\"Corrected Grain\" Leather means leather where the \"Grain\" is covered or removed completely, or in other words, taking \"Split Suede\" and manufactuing a surface for it. \"Patent Leather\" is where PVC is used for the shiny, reflective glossy, glass smooth, colourful leather so very common in women's products. Another example is leather where you can see the \"Grain\" lines but they have a metallic look, these are leather where the \"Grain\" isnt treated much and laminated with a thin sheet of metal, they are called \"Laminated Leather\".\nAll these are not faux leather, they are still true leather as there is leather in the end product. they usually use very poor quality thus cheap leather that do not look aesthetically pleasing to begin with but the end product can be fascinating as well.\n\n---\n\nAll of the above, can be advertised as \"Geniune Leather\" or \"Real Leather\"\n\nwhat is not leather and cannot be advertised as such are things that are made with materials that are not leather. sound very obvious, and it actually is, but it can get confusing.\n\nif you manufature a surface on something in a way akin to \"Corrected Grain\" but choose not to use leather as the backing, instead, opting for something cheaper like textile, then the end product will look similar, possibly feel similar, but is not leather.\n\nThat does not mean faux(pronounced \"fo\") leather is bad, it just mean it is not leather. all the peeling, and rubbish we had all these years come from poor know-how. These days, with better and/or matured manufacturing techniques, materials, etc, faux leather can out perform real leather.\n\nThey can also make very convincing faux leather these days so it can be quite tough to tell. i have even heard they infuse these faux leather with manufactured fragrances for that real leather smell."}, {"body": "I haven't trusted leather companies for some time.

I think they give a lot of insight into the author, or at least CAN, and they're also a place authors can inject irreverent humor without it seeming TOO out of place.  It's kind of like the author's personal stamp on a book, especially when it's a technical book, it might be the only real opportunity the author has to show their personality a bit.\n\nThis is going to come across as self-aggrandizing, but I've had eight books (technical in nature) published and with (almost) each one I've taken great joy in coming up with the wackiest dedication I could.  Obviously, they don't always hit the mark, what with comedy being subjective and all, but I tried, and at least a few times I think succeeded more than failed.\n\nAnyone interested in seeing them?  \n\nToo bad, this is my post, here they come :)\n\n* Book 1:\nFor my wife, who probably does not understand a single thing in this book, but who reminded me why I love her by being more excited for me than I was for myself about my first book.\nFor my two children, for whom I gladly worked all those long hours. Thanks for leaving Daddy alone (usually) long enough to get this done; I owe you each a pony. (I hope you both know about sarcasm by the time you read this!) For Mom and Dad, who started it all with the seemingly innocuous purchase of a \nTimex Sinclair 1000 computer for Christmas 1982 (or 1983\u2014my memory\u2019s a bit flaky 20+ years later!). For John J. Sheridan, for keeping the Shadows off our backs.\n\n*Note: I never expected to write a book, let alone more than the first one, so the first dedication was what I'd call more serious than not, but still hopefully with some humor mixed in... it only gets better... or worse, depending on your perspective and opinion, from here*\n\n* Book 2:\nDedicated to all the animals I\u2019ve eaten over the years, without whom I most certainly would have died a long time ago due to starvation. Well, I suppose I could have been a vegan, but then I\u2019d have to dedicate this to all the plants I\u2019ve eaten, and that would just be silly because very few plants can read. To all my childhood friends who provided me with cool stories to tell: Joe, Thad, \nMeenie, Kenny, Franny, Tubby, Stubby, Kenway, JD, dVoot, Corey, and Francine. To Denny Crane, for raising awareness of Mad Cow disease. Hmm, who am I forgetting? Oh yeah, and to my wife and kids. You guys make life worth living.\n\n* Book 3:\nLet\u2019s see, this is my third book now, the first I dedicated to my wife, kids, mom, dad, and John Sheridan for keeping the Shadows off our backs. The second I dedicated to all the animals I\u2019ve eaten, a batch of childhood friends who helped shape my early life,\nDenny Crane, and my wife and kids once more. So, I\u2019ve covered everyone that counts at least once. So, who to dedicate this one to? Who\u2019s worthy of my adulation and respect? Oh, oh! I know . . . ME! I dedicate this book to ME! OK, fine, I guess I can\u2019t do that.\nSo, I instead dedicate this book to my wife and kids. AGAIN.\nI dedicate this book to my sister because I just realized I didn\u2019t cover everyone that counts, but now I have, sis! I dedicate this book to the folks at Harmonix and Bungie because Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Halo just flat-out rule. I need some Dream Theater, Queensryche, Shadow Gallery, Fates Warning, and Enchant to make my life complete though, so get on that, OK guys? And lastly, I dedicate this book to all the alien species we have yet to meet. I just hope those dudes need books on web programming, because my kids eat like you wouldn\u2019t believe! I\u2019ll even take Quatloos!\n\n* Book 4:\nI\u2019ve written four books now, including this one, and I\u2019ve thanked a lot of people. From the usual suspects such as my wife, children, parents, and friends, to the unusual: fictional characters, various food, alien species, and even myself! At one point I said I had dedicated a book to everyone who matters, but it was my mother-in-law who pointed out I hadn\u2019t dedicated anything to her and thus hadn\u2019t dedicated a book to everyone who matters. That got me to thinking. I\u2019ve actually left out a few important people along the way,\nso let me try to cover all the bases this time around: \nAlbert Einstein, Babe Ruth, George Washington, Francis Ford Coppola, Jean-Luc Picard, Rick Wakeman, John Adams, Galileo Galilei, Lenny Bruce, Les Paul, Leonard Nimoy, Mickey Mantle, Steve Wozniak, Karl Schwarzschild, Lee Majors, Bruce Campbell,\nRobert Kennedy, Wicket the Ewok, Rodney Dangerfield, Ric Flair, Lee and Bill Adama, Scott Baio, Christian Troy, Wally Schirra, Wilton Parmenter, Rod Serling, Nikolai Volkoff, the two old men on The Muppet Show, and of course Davros and The Doctor. Oh yes, and my mother-in-law. Now stop bugging me!\n\n* Book 5:\nThis book is dedicated to all the unsung heroes of the world, those who the absence of which would degrade all our lives to the point where the sweet release of death would seem preferable to continuing this mortal existence. Ironically, the absence of those I refer to would all but guarantee this outcome! I of course refer here to the constants of the physical world: G, the gravitational constant, whose vigilance secures us to this very world; c, the speed of light, who dictates the universal structure of the space-time continuum in which we live; h, Planck\u2019s constant, the existence of which defines the size of quanta used to describe light and other entities upon which we depend; e, the electric constant, which gives rise to the properties of the electromagnetic fields our \ntechnology depends upon; and finally, the Boltzmann constant, without which the relationship of energy at the particle \nlevel to the temperature at the bulk level would be unknown to us. I thank you all, and your unnamed brethren, on behalf of all who inhabit this universe! \n\n*Note: turns out, book 6 and 7 actually had typical, serious dedications, so I'll skip those :)*\n\n* Book 8:\nYou know, after you've written seven books, it gets rather difficult to write something as seemingly simple as a dedication.  I've done all the usual dedications already: wife, kids, parent, friends and acquaintances.  I've even dedicated a few to famous figures, dearly departed artists, inanimate objects, fictional characters I dig, universal constants in physics that makes life possible and, once, even to myself!  Where do you go from there exactly?!  So, after long, tortured hours of thought on this, it finally came to me.  I dedicate this book to: THIS BOOK!  For, without this book, this book would surely not exist.  It is this book that makes this book possible.  Nah, just kidding!  Dedicated to my wife, kids, parents, friends, yada yada yada.

The show is great because of the writing, characters, and atmosphere all of which he does have a hand in. Donald Glover has shown some range in the show but again I feel like he's playing himself and he's comfortable in this role because it's a life imitating art scenario. With Lando Calrissian he's playing an iconic role with certain expectations for how the character is supposed to be portrayed which is where I'm worried. He can't come into this role and \"Dong Lover\" it up he has to play to a certain type and I haven't seen him do it. With a no name actor you don't have any preconcieved notions about the actor, with him playing this role we are already at this point where we have to get over our initial view of Donald Glover playing Lando.

I definitely feel pressured to get married, but I've asked my parents repeatedly if they have a problem with me living at home and they don't. The pressure seems to come from my non-Asian American (aka white and black American) coworkers, who seem to have this cultural pressure to see all young adults moved out on their own. I just don't feel like there's the same pressure in the Asian American culture. Our culture isn't known for being permissive, but in regards to living at home, our parents seem very willing to allow us to live with them. They never charge us rent or anything, either. I guess the idea is that they freely give basic things like food and shelter to their kids (doesn't everyone?) but there are also very strict cultural expectations (like the marriage thing, taking care of your parents when they are old, and generally having to respect your elders and obey them in a way that's much more strict than Western cultures).\n\n\"Independence\" is almost a taboo in Asian American culture. Independence without regard to practicality is definitely seen as a bad thing. Why move out and have to start paying rent and things like that when we can all live together and help each other out in so many ways? Asian culture is very communal. We never got allowance as kids, but as young adults living at home, we never get charged rent, either. Our parents always saw the way American/Western families seemed to be so \"independent\" as in not eating together, each having their own food and their own things and their own separate money, that seemed very negative compared to our more communal culture. In our culture, kids are expected to obey our elders in a much stricter sense, but we're also given so much more freely without regard to who owes whom, this is mine and that is yours, etc.\n\nEdit: If anyone is still reading this, I had a long talk with my parents about them wanting me to get married (I'm a male, early 30s). I have never had a real girlfriend because of the cultural pressure to just focus on education/work. And that's exactly how I was raised. How I am is a result of my upbringing--don't talk to the opposite sex, study hard, work hard, don't socialize. Suddenly, I'm supposed to go from that to finding someone to get married as soon as possible. It's hard. I can't change 180 degrees overnight. I'm very introverted but I do get out, since my hobby is playing music. You would think that musicians get laid left and right, but that's a stereotype. I prefer making music to making conversation. I'm better at writing than talking.\n\nIt's just confusing trying to navigate this Western culture where hooking up seems to come before even getting to know someone, and the Asian culture where you go from being a virgin to getting married in one step. I don't know how to date, and I'm not particularly interested in anyone right now. I just want to focus on myself.

In my experience, despite the ratio being in our favor, you're not generally looked at as a prized or attractive prospect strictly from option disparity. Women ALWAYS have options.

Either you're gay - despite not showing any tendencies whatsoever - or you always wanted to be in medicine without the fortitude to become a doctor or maybe you just fell ass backwards into it; none of which coming off as alpha male clap trap. This ends up with you being viewed more as a gay best friend. Even the title 'nurse' commands no masculine respect. Truth is, male nurses live in a fuck ton of friend zones. Generally female nurses are much more interested in attracting the attention of firemen, medics, other docs, that hot shot new attending that just came in, etc. As the saying goes how people generally prefer to fuck up, not down, social status matters; the occasional rn to rn fuck after a work party being the exception. It's more often you'll hear of a male nurse hooking up with aides, secretaries, hr, radiology techs. That said I found the way to overcome these obstacles was to simply become the best i could be in my field. Certifications up the ass, taking the job seriously while keeping things fun and light, offering to help wherever needed, taking and excelling at leadership opportunities, becoming someone that people look to in times of trauma of which there's plenty in the ED. In truth the most sexually rampant period of my life came from my time as a charge nurse, easily topping my college experience.

Gravity is much easier to observe and predict due to celestial bodies only interacting through it. (If you don't assume dark energy and dark matter to be quirks of gravity). Climate change on the other hand is a mechanism within a chaotic system. New effects can pop up, others can be over or underestimated.\n\nEdit:\nFor those, who think, I'm disputing climate change, an answer to a comment from one of you:\n\nI'm not disputing the change of climate induced by man. I mentioned climate change being an effect in a chaotic system. Chaotic systems are characterized by smallest changes in initial conditions fundamentally changing the macroscopic behaviour. I'm disputing that computational models deployed to QUANTIFY this effect and extrapolate the climate into the future can be accurate as they are flawed by climate being a chaotic system. Gravity does not operate within a chaotic system. Interactions between its agents can be isolated and thus QUANTIFIED (earth's orbit around the sun etc.), while a thermometer can be rising due to multiple reasons.\n\nA better comparison would have been, disputing climate change is like disputing, that airplanes can fly. Both mechanisms operate in a chaotic system and can only be quantifiably understood by accounting for Turbulence via a model in the Navier Stokes equations, in the case of flying.\n\nEdit 2: Those pointing out, that celestial movements are also chaotic, as soon, as multiple bodies are involved: Of course that's true, the entire universe is a chaotic system. However, for the scope of the general public, most relevant questions regarding gravity can be approximated by collapsing it to a 2-body problem, which is non-chaotic (You're not evaluating the moon and the center of the galaxy, when you're calculating, how a dropping apple accelerates). For climate, you have to do that. So comparing it to gravity removes the complexity of the matter for the understanding, that the general public has. And the general public are the ones, they are trying to convince here. Hence, in my opinion, this comparison is misleading.\n\n"}, {"body": "Sort this thread by controversial if you were thinking of killing yourself over the holidays and need one last final nudge.

No grading from the teacher involved and worth every moment of struggle at home. "}, {"body": "My girlfriend's kid got a note very similar to that too.

The constant shit storm at home made it so i had absolutely no time to do homework, and there were severe consequences for late work(such as getting little to no credit). I always passed my tests just fine but homework was most of your grade. I got out with Fs and Ds. I went to another high school that didnt have homework and for the first time in my life i got straight As and Bs. I was also actually learning and retaining knowledge effectively. The education system in the states is a complete and utter joke.\n\nEdit: the school that gave no homework in kicked me out . Their reason was that i wasnt a kid who got into trouble with drugs or got into lits of fights. I had a clean record and the school wasnt allowed to keep me. The teachers were generally upset and felt bad because i was doing so well. So to this day i havent finished high school."}, {"body": "My son had this policy last year in 5th grade.

It wasn't until the end of the year that I learned he was struggling with math...and this after 3 teacher conferences through the year and daily updates from my son about how classes were going. \n\nThis was a single teacher policy and 6th grade is back to 'normal'...so now I have the fun task of getting him used to studying every night again after a year of no homework. \n\nNow I'm not really asking for a debate about the efficacy of homework. But a change like this midstream to a school career does have issues that need to be addressed. So, just a warning to parents facing this policy this year.

It was extra work if you felt like you needed it, but had 0 impact on your grade. This was the only class I got an A in because I hated doing homework even though I knew all the material in my classes. Our teacher was a 25 year old recent grad, teaching kids barely younger than him...so he knew what was up."}, {"body": "Homework is only effective if it has a specific purpose. Example: everyone print out a picture of a 3D geometric object because tomorrow we will analyze them for different kinds of symmetry. Busy work doesn't help struggling students because they have no instant feedback, and it doesn't help strong students because they already understand and should be practicing in class. If there isn't a specific purpose to the homework, then it's not effective. The Finns have very little HW, the South Koreans have a lot. Both are very strong. It just depends.\n\nMore importantly, the structure of grading is incredibly damaging. It's not good, substantive feedback. It labels kids as failures who could be very successful. It's a conflict of interest to have the teacher be the grade giver and the guide to knowledge simultaneously. Grades cause unhealthy competition and cheating with high level students and kill motivation for struggling students who are trying to turn things around. Grades encourage students to take shortcuts and do the minimum to pass rather than actually try to learn and become a better thinker. Grades suck.\n\n<-teacher here"}, {"body": "As much as I didn't like homework, and I think too much is assigned, especially with advanced classes, it IS a good thing.\n\nIt teaches kids how to manage their responsibilities, and not having homework won't prepare them well for a university."}, {"body": "That typeface though.

By the time they get to us they've never learned how to study outside of class, and we don't have time to spend thoroughly teaching them unless they show up to tutorials.

I see it all the time. \n\nStudying is a skill that needs to be learned, and it needs to start on a small scale in elementary."}, {"body": "I'm actually doing something similar to this in my third grade classroom.

"}, {"body": "My son's teacher is taking a similar approach. He is in 2nd grade so she still wants 20 minutes of reading a night and 1 page of math homework. The math usually takes 10 minutes. She said the same thing about studies. Shit the kids are in school for 6 hours a day. Do they really need 1-2 more hours of homework? On Friday she sends home any work they didn't finish in class to complete over the weekend. \n\nShe also has a pretty cool seating arrangement with the kids as well. They have normal desks and desks you can sit on the floor and use. The kids are separated into 3 groups A, B, C. Every week a different group gets to pick their seats. So all the kids get to sit next to different kids through out the year. Also some kids prefer sitting on the floor or at a normal desk. Also if they don't want to sit at the desk they can stand at the desk. She said some kids fidget and if they are forced to sit they won't absorb any information because all their attention will go into keeping from fidgeting. \n\nI'm just glad we have a teacher who is willing to try new things instead of sticking to the same bullshit.

His teacher was saying it was because he wasn't working during the school day so naturally we sided with the teacher.  Come to find out every student in her class had this issue.  It completely ruined school for my son. He doesn't even try anymore because he got so beat down that year.

In high school we all did our homework together, as a group during 0 period and we all got into great colleges and had GPAs between 3.0 and 4.0. \n\nOnce you get to college, and you're expected to know your homework checking Blackboard, you're asked to read about 30-100 pages a night, take home labs, projects, etc. etc. I was totally unprepared because high school was a joke.\n\nI don't see how teaching students to sit down for 30 minutes a night isn't a valid exercise. Maybe if I had some good schoolwork related skills I wouldn't have crashed and burned my freshman year. Obviously, the level of homework assigned didn't help me but I don't see how 0 homework would have been any more beneficial. \n\nLastly, I have met a lot of really subpar parents in my life who will certainly not see make family dinners and all of that good stuff part of their lives because one teacher asked for it.

Once those top students get into college they'll be in trouble, not having developed independent study skills. The students who get homework would be the ones least likely to continue with post-secondary academic study in the first place. This does not bode well for the next generation of scientists, engineers, and academics.\n\nI can assure you, homework research *has* been able to prove through [meta-study analysis](http://ascd.asia/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el198911_cooper.pdf) that homework improves study skills, self-direction, problem solving, learning during leisure time, fact retention, and a host of other things.\n\nYou may not like homework, but then again you probably don't like brussels sprouts either.

"}, {"body": "It's almost like he explicitly said he would do it. "}, {"body": "I spent a lot of time writing this, and it doesn't appear to be showing up in the comments.  I'll try one more time as a top level comment - What the TPP actually does and why:\n\n\nI did a couple hours of research a few months ago.  The best I could come up with from neutral sources was what I put below.  Read all of the bullet points though, because I didn't neatly separate this list into pros and cons (if you even can).\n\n* It is an absurdly complicated subject, so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\n* It would be like NAFTA was for mexico <--> US / Canada, but with a few major differences.  \n\n* The first major difference, is that instead of targeting trade with Mexico, the point was to target trade with south east asia.\n\n* The second major difference was that NAFTA targeted manufacturing jobs (in return for cheaper goods).  TPP targeted service level jobs, and was very explicit in which industries for which countries.\n\n* For example, for the United States, jobs in nursing and retail work were specifically targeted and expected to be strongly adversely affected, in return for significantly expanded asian market penetration for things like American automotive exports and pharmaceuticals.\n\n* How could something like nursing be exported?  Well, that actually gets to the heart of the matter.  For the United States, the point of the TPP (and its sister acts) was to greatly, greatly strengthen and enforce IP law for south east asia, to match already existing IP and trade law in the US and Europe.\n\n* So whereas right now your bank probably hires American programmers, instead of programmers from Cambodia, for purely safety and enforcement reasons, that would change tomorrow.  And with the TPP, if you are a programmer, this would adversely affect you.  But nursing was specifically targeted, as bringing SE asia more in line with HIPAA guarantees would make it legally feasible to outsource more hospital overhead offshore.\n\n* This all means you could expect major offshoring of what are right now considered reputable and secure jobs in America, and for the act to be quite transformative for the economy.  In short, if your job isn't tied to the USA, and is easy to offshore, but hasn't been for logistic, legal or economic reasons, the TPP almost certainly changed the math involved with that equation (though of course it will be different for every job / industry).\n\n**Okay, so if America is trading away good jobs in entire industries, what does it get in return?**\n\n* Right now, if you are a large business that wants to get into Asian markets, you have two problems.  1) If you open in China, there's a good chance your designs will be eventually be stolen and given to a Chinese company, which the Chinese government will then later support at your expense.  And 2) The rest of SE asia has similar problems to varying degrees, and they all trade with China.\n\n* Additionally, right now Europe's economy is looking dead for the foreseeable future.  And since America isn't spending money jumpstarting our own economy, we're not likely to grow at a large rate any time soon either.\n\n* But asian economies are booming.  And as they do so, they are trading with each other, and making trade deals with each other that don't include us.  And that's a major disadvantage for America and Europe.\n\n* So the purpose of the TPP, from a western viewpoint, is to get SE asia into the same economic and legal framework as the western world, and open their markets to western companies.  \n\n* The second purpose of the TPP, is to get China to play ball too.  Right now, if we tell China to open their markets, and enforce western IP law, they'll laugh in our face (and do so).  We don't have the bartering chips for that deal.  But if the rest of SE asia is already doing so with the West, and builds their economies around such laws, then 15-20 years from now, it won't just be Europe / USA telling China to open their markets and enforce international IP law, it will be the vast majority of China's trading partners.  In short, it would be an economic coup d'etat for western powers, that would bring a _lot_ of money to large western companies and give Washington much more power in Asia.  If you are a citizen of the west, this is almost certainly a good thing.\n\n* So Obama and Clinton's bet, is that if we don't make a deal like the TPP, then Chinese (and by extension SE asian) companies are going to spring up as international competitors to American firms anyway.  And that increased competition represents lost profits that could otherwise have been made by western companies trading in China.  So by trading those jobs to outsourcing now, the US would be in a much more dominant position later, and it is worth the trade.\n\n**Okay, is that line of thinking valid?**\n\nYes and No.\n\n* If you are a CEO, or a powerful washington person.  Then yes, unequivocally.  The TPP means continued western and American worldwide economic hegemony and should be strongly fought for.  EU / USA firms cannot do business in China.  That's a major economic disadvantage for any western firm playing on that level.\n\n* For people who's jobs are not offshored, then yes, this is probably a good plan.  Just like NAFTA resulted in cheaper goods, TPP should result in cheaper services across the board.  \n\n* But if your job can be offshored (and the list of offshorable jobs the TPP will make cost effective to offshore is large), then it is more complicated.\n\n* If the USA had a real economic safety net, and put forward programs towards retraining and revitalizing areas specifically hit by offshoring and globalization, then you could vote for the TPP confidently.  This, for example is how the scandanavian countries handled integration into the EU, and overall there are very few cases of real economic hardship as the result of that integration.  Overall, it was a success story.\n\n* But after NAFTA, the USA implemented no such programs, whatsoever.  Economists at the time, believed them to be unnecessary.  The thinking was, that if free trade agreements resulted in more trade, which resulted in more jobs, then people who lost their jobs to outsourcing should have no difficulty finding new jobs in a free market.\n\n* The reality was that outsourcing resulted in chain effects whereby entire regions of the country lost all their good jobs, and the good jobs that remained moved to other US locations.  Combined with the fact that many people woke up one day to find that their entire career was no longer employable in their home country, meant that they simply could not find new work.  Add in again Greenspan's attempts to 'lower worker mobility to increase American labor competitiveness', and the end result is that today, in 2017, many families that lost their jobs due to nafta STILL are not employed.\n\nSo at the end of the day, you have to make a call.  Do you think that America will be like Scandanavia, and reinvest a portion of the profits reaped by greater access to Asian markets on economic growth, unemployment benefits, worker retraining and government programs?  Or do you think that America will call those things socialism, ignore the problem, and allow large companies to reap the economic rewards unmolested?\n\nPersonally, I fall into the second category, so I am very, very happy to see the TPP fail.  I think that given the second viewpoint, outsourcing service level jobs, in THIS economy, would be a death sentence for many, many people.  But that said, if you think that the first option is a possibility, then the TPP should be strongly supported.  And really, in an ideal world, if we could trust that America would take care of the people who would be harmed by the outsourcing, then we would want the TPP to pass, because increased trade and American competitiveness in the future is something that should be encouraged and worked towards."}, {"body": "[removed]"}, {"body": "No matter what my opinions on trump is, he's doing what he said he would if he became president and he's not wasting time.

Then healthcare reform, i.e. only repeal Obamacare when a better plan is ready and open up interstate insurance.\n\nI say this knowing I'll probably be downvoted to Oblivion, but I firmly believe that he will do what he said. And if he doesn't I'll be the first to show my distaste in the voters booth in 2020.\n\nEdit: I'll expand on the wall. I've always looked at the wall in a metaphorical perspective. Fund law enforcement and beef up border patrol security and in effect, create a wall. If we did wind up building one that's ok too. As far as what I think is reasonable for immigration reform. Voter ID laws. Illegal to open bank accounts, get drivers licenses, insurance, or be on welfare if illegal.\n\nEdit 2: Hey thanks everyone for all the responses!

A few years ago everyone ragged on Rebecca Black's \"Friday\" (and then subsequently \"Saturday\"), but the reality is that parents paying for kids to record music videos for $5k+, like Black's parents did, is a common way to break into a local scene or sign with a small label. It helps that Swift is gifted and can actually sing, but at the end of the day, the more connections you have and more money you can throw at a career, the greater chances you have of success."}, {"body": "someone finally said it.\n\nIt's like watching DJ Khaled tell you that life is always amazing and you're just like, \"mate... you own a jet ski and get paid to say 'another one'...\""}, {"body": "If *nobody* followed their dreams, we'd have a lot fewer scientists, artists, and so on.

"}, {"body": "If Bo doesn't know how to be successful, then I guess I'll bite.\n\nHere's a quote by John Gardner in *The Art of Fiction.*\n\n\"Books on writing tend to make much of how difficult it is to become a successful writer, but the truth is that, though the ability to write well is partly a gift--like the ability to play basketball well, or to outguess the stock market--writing ability is mainly a product of good teaching supported by a deep-down love of writing. Though learning to write takes time and a great deal of practice, writing up to the world's ordinary standards is fairly easy. As a matter of fact, most of the books one finds in drugstores, supermarkets, and even small-town libraries are not well written at all; a smart chimp with a good creative-writing teacher and a real love of sitting around banging a typewriter could have written books vastly more interesting and elegant. [This is like saying a human with a love for bananas could leap from tree to tree.] Most grown-up behavior, when you come right down to it, is decidedly second-class. People don't drive their cars as well, or wash their ears as well, or eat as well, or even play the harmonica well....This is not to say people are terrible and should be replaced by machines; people are excellent and admirable creatures; efficiency isn't everything. But for the serious young writer who wants to get published, it is encouraging to know that most of the professional writers out there are push-overs.\"\n\nThe moral here? Mediocrity is the norm, so rise above the mediocrity. That's what Gardner did. Practiced all day every day, where other writers might only write no more than 3 hours. Rewrote his books hundreds of times (literally), and was even said to have been typing away while he went through a CAT scan."}, {"body": "I normally don't agree with the top posts here that are advice.

The day's events have been moving extremely fast and been quite confusing. This morning the former PM Sigmundur Gunnlaugson said in a radio interview that the government was standing firm. Then around noon he went to meet with the President of the republic (the non-political head of state) to demand that the president dismiss parliament and call elections. The president refused this request, and the move was received as a very bizarre and botched powerplay by Gunnlaugsson. Now, around 3 pm, the former prime minister has decided to step down and nominate the vice chairman of his Progressive Party to assume the title of Prime Minister and continue the government coalition.\n\nA few things are clear at the moment. Firstly that this decision was made by the leaders of the Progressive Party alone, which is only one of two parties in the coalition government. The other ruling party, the Independence Party, might have completely different ideas about what should follow and who, if anyone, should assume the prime minister-ship. The opposition in parliament is furthermore adamant that this will not be enough and state that the only sensible thing to do at this point is to call snap elections.\n\nI'll try to update you on events as they unfold.\n\nEdit: Typos.\n\n**Update**: The minister of finance, Bjarni Benediktsson, and chairman of the other ruling Independence party has just returned from his meeting with the president. He says he will sit down and discuss what the following events will be with the proposed new prime minister of the Progressive Party Sigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson. He says he will not demand the prime ministership for himself but he is sounding like he would like the current government to continue and finish their term. This is not surprising, but I doubt it'll change the call for snap elections by the opposition and the populace.\n\n**Update 2**: I gotta go to work, but the world's eyes and huge media outlets seem to be following this keenly so you should have no problem keeping informed.

We can dispense this if a prescription is written for Adrenaclick or Epinephrine.\n\n**Make sure your doctor writes a script for Adrenaclick or it is illegal for us to dispense this cheaper generic to you**\n\nEdit: The injection device of each product is what limits the A/B rating. Adrenaclick and EpiPen have different autoinjector systems. Yes the regulations are that strict.

Anyway he cut it in half and told me to put it under my Lip Like tobacco and my airways opened up about 1 minute later. He drove me to the hospital I got steroid injections to treat the reaction, but the docter was dumbfounded on what my grandpa did. Turns when my grandpa first became a rancher pharmaceutical company's were still using animal organs to make hormones. He use to sell organs to these company's that's how he new what to do. So what I don't get is why this shit is so expensive yet I can get epi and nore epi from a fucking pig kidney.

Thank you for bringing all that up. \n\nThere is a manufacturer discount from Mylan as I mention below that can save up to $300 (https://www.activatethecard.com). It doesn't work if you don't have insurance and personally for me, it only took $100 off but perhaps it was going towards my huge ass deductible. Some redditors have said that as the EpiPen generic is not an A/B generic, its injector is different and perhaps more difficult to use, so it may be worthwhile to get your PCP to prescribe both medicines for you in order to decide what you want. As far as the generic goes, if you download the coupon from the link below, it says out of pocket you can save $300, and since its cash price is only $109, the coupon should make it free for literally everyone.\n\nAnd there are programs like the $4/$10 deal that Walmart and others do. I know CVS/Target uses ScriptSave, and for some maintenance meds it brings it down to $4.\n\nTl;dr: Read the links. \n\nEdit: I found this using the GoodRx app. This is one of the most versatile tools at the hands of patients, doctors, and pharmacy workers alike in keeping drug prices in check and it's FREE! I use it everyday I work whenever I see expensive drugs, and it helps like 80% of the time. It is NOT insurance, and the downside of using its discounts is that your payments won't go to your deductible, but if you're like me, and you'll never reach your deductible, you should give it a shot and compare it to how much insurance will pay. While it doesn't tell you how much your insurance will charge you, it does tell you generally the cheapest(Walmart, although I have heard from some coworkers that Walmart doesn't take GoodRx at all) and most expensive pharmacies (lol CVS most of the time) and provides its own discounts that sometimes beat insurance especially if you have a deductible. The Tips tab on GoodRx can help you find if there are manufacturer coupons you can sign up for. Manufacturer coupons only exist for brand name medications and typically only cover 30 or 90 day supplies, and the 90 day supply is almost always cheaper. GoodRx is accurate almost all the time in displaying coupons, but it isn't for the EpiPen, which just discontinued its full coverage program, instead replacing it with one that could \"potentially\" save you $300. Seriously, screw Mylan Pharmaceuticals. I'm deathly allergic to nuts and legumes so I have to have an epipen and I had to pay $535 out of pocket so this issue is personal to me. \n\nCVS Pharmacy Tech here!\n\nTo clarify you have to get a prescription for ADRENACLICK OR EPINEPHRINE in order for us to fill the medication.\n\n\nThere is also a patient assistance program that will allow you to receive Adrenaclick for free by the manufacturer Impax Laboratories.

What made this case different was the fact that the guy wasn't filming a specific action, he just stood outside the police station and started filming, which would lead a reasonable officer to wonder if he was casing the joint.  There was nothing unreasonable about detaining him to ask what he was doing, get his name, etc, he shouldn't,  however, have been arrested. \n\nSo in order to let this officer off, they claimed the right was not clearly established at the time (a white lie) but would be from here on out. So from this point on, they can ask questions and get your ID, but they cannot arrest you merely for filming them. Had he been arrested for filming a specific interaction with the public, I'm sure the decision would have been unanimous that the right was clearly established. But this was an unusual case, the guy just did it to provoke the officers, who weren't quite sure what to do. What the court did here was to say there simply say that, no you can't be arrested for recording even under these circumstances, but they let the officers off with a little creative legal jockeying.

It was fucking awesome!  Kill 'Em All had just been released, and Bill Graham was always keen on giving up 'n' coming bands their share of the spotlight.  I remember hearing after the show they thought they were 'all that' and in typical rocker fashion either James or Lars destroyed a bathroom.  Graham was hella pissed and called to see the band first thing in the am, liked being called to the principles office.  I'm sure they were completely hung over.

He asked my recommendation for a white wine before dinner and then for an entree suggestion based on the red wine he'd brought for the party. He made it a point to sincerely let me know he enjoyed both of my recommendations after they had arrived. \n\nHe was accompanied by his wife, Karen Boyer, with whom he was affectionate and attentive. He made time to speak with all the guests at dinner with the most gentle and considerate demeanor. \n\nAt the end of dinner, the guests took turns making toasts. When it was Mr. Wilder's turn, he simply stood up and opened his mouth to sing a few bars of a made up song. The only words were, \"I love you, love you, love you, yes I love you, love you, love you.\" I got big tears in my eyes. He was humble, kind, so full of love for his family and friends.

It is to this day still one of my most prized possessions, which pushed me towards physics - although I went down the nuclear path in the end, astronomy and cosmology still holds a deep personal interest to me!\n\nMy actual question is regarding black holes. As most people are aware, once something has fallen into a black hole, it cannot be observed or interacted with again from the outside, but the information does still exist in the form of mass, charge and angular momentum. However scientific consensus now holds that black holes \u201cevaporate\u201d over time due to radiation mechanisms that you proposed back in the 70s, meaning that the information contained within a black hole could be argued to have disappeared, leading to the black hole information paradox. \n\nI was wondering what you think happens to this information once a black hole evaporates? I know that some physicists argue that the holographic principle explains how information is not lost, but unfortunately string theory is not an area of physics that I am well versed in and would appreciate your insight regarding possible explanations to this paradox!"}, {"body": "Hello sir, thank you for the AMA.

You\u2019re such an impressive person.\n\nWhen we think about the multiverse theory, it is very likely that our Universe is part of 'anything else', isn\u2019t it? I mean planets are part of solar systems. Solar systems are part of galaxies. Galaxies are part of the universe. So, my questions are:\n\n* What do you think about the multiverse theory?\n* If you believe it is likely, how do you think does this 'row' end? Are multiverses part of other multiverses?\n* What do you think, how did this all begin? And how will it end?\n\nIt blows my mind when I think about that there could have been billion of other universes before our universe even existed. I mean, there could have been million of civilizations which already reached their final phase and died. Compared to this we are just at the very beginning, aren\u2019t we? How likely do you think is that whole theory?\n\nThank you very much again, Mr. Hawking. \n\n*Edit - Just for clarification: I'm referring to the \"multiverse theory\" which says that \"our\" universe is a part of a bigger \"something\". (Not the multiverse where you're a rock star or anything like that)  At least for me, this is absolutely likely because it all starts with planets which are part of solar systems, which are part of galaxies, which are part of the universe.

"}, {"body": "Dear Professor Hawking,\nMy name is Zoe and I am a sixteen year old living in Los Angeles.  I am a long time Girl Scout (11 years) and am now venturing forth unto my Gold Award.  The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award in girl scouting, it is equivalent to the Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts.  It teaches a lot of life skills with research, paperwork and interviews, but also with hosting workshops and reaching out to people. The project requires at least 80 hours of work, which I find less daunting then making the project leave a lasting affect (which is the other big requirement of the project).  To do that, I am creating a website that will be  a lasting resource for years to come.\n\nFor my project, I am raising awareness about AAC (Alternative Augmented Communication) devices.  Even though I am not an AAC user, I have see the way that they can help someone who is nonverbal through the experience of my best friend since elementary school.  I want to thank you for your help already with my project, by just being such a public figure that you are, I can say. \"An AAC device is a computer that someone uses when they are nonverbal (gets blank stares), you know like Professor Hawking's computer (then they all get it)\"  \n\nI have already presented at California State University Northridge and held a public workshop to raise awareness for AAC devices.  For my presentation, I explained what AAC devices are and how they new an option for people who are nonverbal.  They are such a new option, that many people do not know they exist.  As soon as my best friend knew that she could get an AAC device, she got one and it helped her innumerably.  Before she had it, all she had to communicate was yes and no, but when she got her device, there were so many more things for her to say.  One instance, where she was truly able to communicate was when we were working on our science fair project.  We had been researching the effects that different types of toilet paper had on the environment, and I had proposed that we write our data on a roll of toilet paper (clean), to make it creative and interesting when we had to present it to the class.  Before, she would have just said no to the idea if she did not like it, but we would not know why, but with her AAC device, she was able to be an active part of the project by saying no and explaining why, she said \"it was gross\".  That is true communication at it's finest and I have heard of other similar instances like this.  \n\nBut my project is not only for the potential AAC users, I am also aiming my project toward everyone else.  I want to get rid of some of the social awkwardness that comes with using an AAC device.  It is not that people are rude on purpose, they just do not know how to interact.  One instance of this that really stood out to me had to do with the movie \"The Theory of Everything.\"  I was reading an interview with Eddie Redmayne about how he got to meet you, in the interview he said that he had researched all about you and knew that you use an AAC device, but when he finally got to meet you, he did not know how to act and kept talking while you were trying to answer.  This awkwardness was not on purpose, but awareness and education on how to interact with AAC users, would help fix this situation.  My best friend also had problems with this same issue when she went to a new school. I addressed this with my project by holding a public workshop where AAC users and non AAC users came and learned about AAC devices.  They made their own low technology AAC boards and had to use them for the rest of the workshop to communicate. We also had high technology AAC devices for them to explore and learn about.  The non AAC user participants and were able to meet real AAC users.  To me, AAC is meant to break the barrier of communication, not put up new walls because of people's ignorance of the devices.\n\nTo quote The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, \"My thoughts are stars, that can not be fathomed into constellations\". with an AAC Device, we were able to see just a few of those stars, and with more practice we will be able to see constellations.  With more wide spread use and knowledge of AAC devices this can happen for more people.  Thank your for taking to the time to answer everyone's questions - here are my questions for you:\n\n1. In what ways would you like to see AAC devices progress?\n\n2. As a user of an AAC device, what do you see as your biggest obstacle in communicating with non AAC users?\n\n3. What voice do you think in - your original voice or your AAC voice?\n\n4. What is one thing that everybody should know about AAC devices?\n\n5. What advice would you give to non AAC users talking to an AAC user?\n\n\nThank you!\nZoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"body": "do we have any idea when approximately will be the 2nd part of the AMA?

The paper\u2019s abstract reads as following:\n\n> \u201cThe matter of friendly AI theory has so far almost exclusively been examined from a perspective of careful design while emergent phenomena in super intelligent machines have been interpreted as either harmful or outright dystopian. The argument developed in this paper highlights that the concept of \u2018friendly AI\u2019 is either a tautology or an oxymoron depending on whether one assumes a morally real universe or not. Assuming the former, more intelligent agents would by definition be more ethical since they would ever more deeply uncover ethical truths through reason and act in accordance with them while assuming the latter, reasoning about matters of right and wrong would be impossible since the very foundation of morality and therefore AI friendliness would be illogical. Based on evolutionary philosophy, this paper develops an in depth argument that supports the moral realist perspective and not only demonstrates its application to friendly AI theory \u2013 irrespective of an AI\u2019s original utility function \u2013 making AGI inherently safe, but also its suitability as a foundation for a transhuman philosophy.\u201d\n\nThe only reason to worry about transhumanly intelligent machines would be if one believed that matters of right and wrong are arbitrary constructs. A position very popular in post modern academic circles. Holding such a believe however would make advocating for one particular moral stance over another fundamentally untenable as one would have no rational ground to stand on from which to reason from in its favor.\n\nMany thanks for taking your time to do this important AMA and looking forward to your comments."}, {"body": "Hello Dr. Hawking,\n\nI shared your concern until recently when I heard another AI researcher explain how it's irrational.\n\nSpecifically, the argument was that there's no reason to be tied to our human form.  Instead we should see AI as the next stage in humanity - a collective technological offspring so to speak.  Whether our biological offspring or technological offspring go on, should not matter to us.\n\nIndeed, worrying about AI replacing us is analogous (albeit to a lesser extent) to worries about genetic engineering or bionic organ replacement.  Many people have made the argument that 'playing God' in these respects is unnatural and should not be allowed and this feels like an extension of that.\n\nSome of my colleagues have published a few papers showing that humans trust technology more when it's anthropomorphized or that we see things as unnatural as immoral. The worry about AI seems to be a product of this innate tendency to fear things that aren't natural. \n\nUltimately, I'm wondering what you're thoughts are about this?  Are we simply being irrationally tied to our human form? Or is there a specific reason why AI replacing us would be detrimental (unless you are also predicting a 'terminator' style genocide)"}]}, {"id": "2wwdep", "title": "We are Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald from the Oscar-winning documentary CITIZENFOUR.

Upon walking through the doors, however, I felt a mixture of disbelief and disappointment: A decent third of the store was dedicated to books, another section featured various ritual supplies, and the rest of the space was filled out with the oddest collection of Jesus-themed home decor that I could have imagined. For instance, there were these little porcelain statues of cherub-like children in different poses, each of which had a Bible quote emblazoned on its base.\n\nOne thing that I *didn't* see, though, was the style of candle that I'd been hoping to find. This prompted me to approach the store's one employee - a fifty-year-old woman with a disapproving expression on her face - and ask about them.\n\n\"'Prayer candles?'\" she repeated back to me. \"For a church?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" I replied. \"No, these are... well, they're about the size of a Pringles can, and you're supposed to light them when...\"\n\n\"We do *not* carry those!\" the woman suddenly interrupted. \"Those are *Catholic* candles.\" The venom in her voice was unmistakable, so I just thanked her for the \"help\" and left.\n\nSuffice to say, her behavior didn't strike me as being very \"Christian.\"\n\n**TL;DR: Those stores sell books, church supplies, and tchotchkes... but God help you if you ask for the wrong ones.**"}, {"body": "I've yet to find one that called itself a 'bible store', but most style themselves 'christian book store' and carry just about everything you could expect to find in most bookstores and entertainment shops with a more Jesus Friendly^TM theme.\n\nSo typically you'll see A LOT of kids morality books, stationary, rosaries and crucifixes, various baubles, and lots of other gift type items.

He sought more than $75,000 in damages.\n\nThe lawsuit made several wild claims, including that in the summer of 1999 he was called a \u201cmonkey\u201d by a producer and learned other black employees had been called the same.\n\nFlanagan alleged that later that year a white employee told him it \u201cbusted her butt that blacks did not take advantage of the free money\u201d available in scholarships to African Americans attending college.\n\nHe further alleged that a black criminal suspect was referred to as \u201cjust another thug\u201d and that a black tape operator was told to \u201cstop talking ebonics\u201d. The lawsuit reached federal court in Florida. According to public records it was settled out of court in 2001.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWDBJ7 station manager Jeff Marks has described Flanigan as \u201can unhappy man\u201d.\n\n\u201cVester was an unhappy man.

And he did not take that well, we had to call the police to escort him from the building.\n\n\u201cSince then, well, he then filed an action with the Equal Opportunity Employment Committee in which he made all kinds of complaints\u201d about the staff. Flanigan alleged that the staff had made \u201cracial comments\u201d, Marks said, but \u201cnone of them could be corroborated by anyone, we think they were fabricated.\u201d\n\nThe complaint was dismissed, and although employees continued to occasionally see Flanigan \u201cat the grocery store or something\u201d, interaction was limited and rare, Marks said.\n\nHe added that Vicki Gardner, the third gunshot victim, has had emergency surgery and is in stable condition."}, {"body": "Disgusted that this is turning into purely a race thing.

He didn't think it was right to shortchange players when something could be done, so he insisted it go on the cart.\n\n- During a weekend, on a whim, he ported the entire Pokemon battle system to the N64 *with no reference documents.*  On Monday, he showed a producer what he had done, and that was the genesis of Pokemon Stadium.\n\n- Iwata and Sakurai got it in their heads that a sumo game would be cool.  So during the weekends and lunch breaks, they started working on this 2D game where getting knocked out of the ring would cause you to lose a life.  Inspired by a screensaver Miyamoto had of Mario fighting Bowser, they tried putting Nintendo characters in the role and developed a prototype of the game without it being greenlit.  Miyamoto loved the idea and Super Smash Bros. was born.\n\n- When working on Earthbound, development was going badly.  The game wasn't being made in a way the programmers could easily make new content.  Iwata sat down with Itoi, who didn't have a ton of game development experience, and said \"Look, we can keep doing it this way and it will take two more years and the project might get cancelled.  Or I can help you start over and it will take six months.\"  Itoi agreed to reboot the project and Iwata got it done in time.\n\n- When Iwata was General Manager of Nintendo (a position so high up that his promotion after this was CEO), his friend Sakurai came to him and told him that Smash Bros. Melee wouldn't be ready in time for Christmas.  The development guideline was too tight and the code was rather buggy.

But when I was spending Sunday with my girlfriend and had several people tell me at the same time that Satoru Iwata, president and CEO of Nintendo had died, I couldn\u2019t help but cry.\n\nHe was the closest thing that I have had to an Idol. He wasn\u2019t your typical CEO businessman that isn\u2019t relevant to the company, he worked his way up there through pure merit since he joined HAL laboratories after he graduated college. I\u2019m a Computer Science major and my dream is to be a game programmer and bring joy and fun to people just like the games that were the only things keeping me happy in the darkest times of my life (which maybe around two people excluding my family actually know about). On top of enjoying his works personally, what truly inspired me from Mr. Iwata was the absolute genius he was. He is called the Genius Programmer, and for good reason. There are several famous stories about his programming feats.\n\n1. Reprogramming the entirety of Earthbound (Mother 2) from scratch. Earthbound was having major troubles getting out the door because they couldn\u2019t fit the whole game onto a cartridge and was extremely buggy and broken. The code was a complete mess and reportedly almost incomprehensible. Iwata single handedly reprogrammed Earthbound so elegantly that reportedly he implemented a fully functioning assembly language just to handle the text boxes.\n\n2. When the Nintendo disk system was canned and they needed to port Pok\u00e9mon Stadium over to the Nintendo 64, Iwata had to port the entire battle system over to a different architecture. The problem was that the code again was very messy and was missing all the documentation, meaning he was completely blind as to how to do it. He did it in a WEEK.\n\n3. Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver. HAL again was feeling the heat and couldn\u2019t fit all of Johto onto a single Gameboy Color cartridge. Iwata came in again and manage to optimize and compress the code so much that not only were they able to fit all of Johto in finally, they had so much extra space thanks to him that they were able to fit the entirety of Kanto into the game as well.\n\nIn my Japanese class last semester where I gave a 10 minute speech about the history of the video game industry in Japan, I spent at least 3 minutes talking just about Mr. Iwata. I remember looking up all sorts of words I needed just for him, because I wanted to pay him the proper respect he deserved. I can only ever dream of being as important and powerful of a programmer that he was. I can only ever imagine creating such amazing games that he had a hand in creating over his too short of a life. He still is the person I respect most in my field and will continue to work hard to achieve even a small fraction of the greatness that was Mr. Iwata.\n\nPlease Understand."}, {"body": "Incredibly awful.

Why do big companies behave as they do? WHY do they push for outsourcing, special visas, deregulation, etc? The answer is pretty obvious - share price and shareholders, and **the law** says put shareholders first.\n\nIt's often called \"shareholder pre-eminence\" and it's in the [Companies Act](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=jzWTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT184&lpg=PT184&dq=shareholder+preeminence&source=bl&ots=Aqp0Z0kfPS&sig=W3TMC02G3QBCSKYkVoqkyoVmUak&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwih-qOezZjSAhVEV7wKHfWTDJQQ6AEIHDAC#v=onepage&q=shareholder%20preeminence&f=false). There has been an awareness of the [inherent](https://hbr.org/2009/07/shareholders-first-not-so-fast) [problems](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-kVbli9u1KUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false) of this model for quite some time, but it is *so big, so entrenched* in how markets around the world operate, nobody knows how to change it.\n\nThe initial theory was that shareholding was good, because \"wisdom of the markets\" will prevail over companies behaving irresponsibly. This is a decent theory if you *assume shareholders are actually interested in the company*. But for a long time, they have not been, because *shares themselves* are traded for *profit* - which means if a company wants capital investment from shareholders, they have to ensure their share price **keeps going up**. And **that** is one of the major causes of these problems.\n\nWhere is the logic in asking CEOs to \"step up\", when their board will simply vote them out if they don't do what is best for the almighty share price? CEOs can lose their jobs if they \"step up\", so why should they?\n\nSo companies are forced to behave in exactly the way we did not want them to, basically because shareholders aren't \"invested\" - personally - in companies any more. Shareholders just want their share to go up so they can trade them and make a profit. This is profit motive gone too far - and it's **the law** that this is the case. If leaders like Trudeau want companies to change their behaviour, they all need to get together and **change the rules** so that shareholders once again become invested in the actual reason a company exists, not just because it makes for a good share trade.\n\n(ed: This is kind of how crowd-funding works - you buy \"a share\" of the project, so it gains capital to kick off, then you get something back for it, and everyone's happy. You don't go and *trade your investment* when the project becomes popular, **because the price of a share never changes**. However, if that does come about, mark my words; a \"crowd-funding share market\" will emerge and will incentivise the same behaviours in crowd-funded projects we're blaming CEOs and companies for now.)\n\nSo there has been no \"wisdom of the market\" for a long time now, due mainly to the \"industrialising\" of share trading - which was [once restricted](http://www.tradingacademy.com/resources/financial-education-center/history-of-trading.aspx) to small, individual players, but is now an industrialised enterprise in itself, which has basically turned the market \"neurotic\" and hangs like a sword of Damocles over CEOs and corporate behaviour - keep increasing profits aka share price, or capital investment (and your board) will go find someone else who will."}, {"body": ">\u201cIncreasing inequality has made citizens distrust their governments.

To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain\u2019t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you\u2019re so smart, why ain\u2019t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child\u2019s hand \u2013 glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.\n\nAmericans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor.

There was a much less adversarial relationship between employers and employees because rationing, round the clock shift work, and the draft applied to everybody. \n\n(b) Most of the men returning from the war were just really happy to be alive and we tend to underestimate the impact of that on their professional lives. He described his thought process as something like: \"Too bad Jim got that promotion instead of me, but fuck it, I'm not dead in France.\" He noticed his veteran colleagues tending to get along really well with each other and management because of that attitude. \n\nWith that in mind, he noticed a real change with the boomers (my parents generation) as they came of age. He felt that lack of shared sacrifice and appreciation for life contributed to the culture of runaway corporate greed he saw in the 1980's. \n\nI'm hopeful that my generation (the millenials) will help swing the pendulum back closer to the experience of my grandfather, due in part to our shared hardship in the ridiculously fucked up crushing student loan/unpaid internship/short-term contract oriented economy. \n\nSpeaking personally, I know that if I started a business I would lean towards a lot of decisions that would benefit my employees because I would want to do the opposite of what I've experienced so far.

However, returning to school in the fall, I am looking at adding to my student debt by about $58,000 dollars a year for the next four years. This means I will graduate medical school with around $232,000 dollars in student debt going into my residency, on top of the student debt I accrued in my undergraduate studies. Luckily I will be fortunate enough to have a high paying career once I am in my early thirties 7-10 years from now. However, there are students who are not as fortunate as myself, who will have the same amount of debt (and for some, more) with a job that does not pay nearly enough for the amount they were forced to spend on education.\n\n[I recently read about your proposal for a bill that ensures free tuition to American college students.](http://college.usatoday.com/2015/05/19/bernie-sanders-issues-bill-to-make-4-year-colleges-tuition-free/) My question to you is, when you hopefully someday in the future get this legislation through and approved, what will happen to the students who already have mountains of debt to pay off in their names?

If against, what alternatives come to your mind for combating rising inequality and poverty in the United States?"}, {"body": "1. Thank you for the good question. I believe I have been consistent throughout my political life in terms of my basic values and what I stand for. Obviously, when you are a United States senator working in a conservative environment, you often have to do the best that you can within the circumstances that you find yourself. Two particular examples: last year, I helped write the most comprehensive veterans legislation passed in many years. Trust me, I had to change my position on very important aspects of veterans' health care in order to get it passed. In terms of health care, I am an advocate of a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. I voted for the Affordable Care Act, not because I think it is the end place as to where we should be, but because I was able to get a major provision in it that greatly expanded primary health care -- which is helping many millions of people today. So the bottom line is that you have to stick by your values but when you're in an elected position, especially when you're in a conservative Congress, now and then you're going to have to compromise.\n\n2. Great question. And let me repeat what I have said many times. The only way we deal with the major issues facing our country -- raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, addressing climate change in a bold way, overturning Citizens United, demanding that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, making college affordable for all, etc. -- is when ordinary people put massive pressure on the Congress. Right now, the Congressional leadership represents the interests of the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations. Instead of raising the minimum wage, they're giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting nutrition programs. Nothing will change unless millions of people demand it and that's what this campaign is all about -- mobilizing people at the grassroots level."}, {"body": "Hey Bernie, thanks for doing this.

We need to pick our battles and actually support the new president when he's actually in the right.

When we have a Democrat president who tried to cut social security, we need to actively support the Republican opposition who DOESN'T want to (even if we also need to actively oppose that Republican on other issues). \n\nAnd for example, the TPP is reportedly dead in the water now. Thanks to Trump. When the powers that be expected Clinton to win, the TPP was going forward, but as soon as Trump surprisingly won, it was dead. That's a good thing! The TPP was a bad trade deal, more crony capitalism like NAFTA, and it would steal away our sovereignty. Corporations would be allowed to sue the government in private international tribunals if they happen to not like the government's regulations. So say if a fracking company thinks they could have made more profits by polluting more, and they take it to one of these tribunals that always side with the corporations, they can sue the government to force the government to allow them to pollute by making them pay for the lost profits the regulations against polluting cost them. Really, it was a HUGE step in a global corporate takeover. I don't like Trump, but he was right on this issue and he's delivered results just by winning the election. That's a *good thing*.

Some sites, like Twitter, make all their public activities, in this case tweets, available without authorization. \n\nHowever under the terms of service in using Twitter's, and most others, when an application using the API is notified that an item was deleted they must also remove it from their system.This is where these sites got into trouble and the \"internal debate\" at Twitter took place. Under the terms this means that when a politician deleted a tweet, these site must also remove the tweet, which they don't because their whole purpose is to prevent this for politicians.\n\nThis rule requiring applications to delete tweets is blanket and applies to all Twitter accounts including yours. The spirit of this rule is to try and prevent that tweet you mistakenly made from being stuck out there and you can never take it back. So the debate at Twitter was, should this rule exclude politicians? And judging by the result it was no. With this decision these archiving sites were in violation of Twitter's terms of service, so their API access was revoked and were most likely sent DMCA requests to remove what tweets they had already copied since all tweets are technically copyrighted by Twitter thus shutting down the sites.\n\nWhether or not you agree with Twitter's decision to not classify politicians accounts as exclusions to the deletion rule, Twitter's goal is to protect its users' right to privacy.\n\nOn a side note I have seen people mention that these sites could switch to web crawling to obtain these tweets. The answer is no they could not, probably. This comes back to tweets being copyrighted materials of Twitter, meaning they could make the case that by archiving the tweets without Twitter's permission they are violating the DMCA.

This was basically my view coming home from work last night, although it died died down in that particular area by then.  The fire started just after 4PM yesterday and it spread across 11 miles, burning 5,000 acres in the process, over the span of just a few hours.  We've lost about 19,000 acres so far and at least 100 homes have been lost, along with many more that been damaged to some degree.  I still don't know yet if my mom and grandmother have their home; they were evacuated last night and had to come to my house in Lake Isabella, which is thankfully mostly untouched, although we are still under threat.\n\nI was working at one of the local campgrounds (Rivernook Campground) last night and we were trying to take in as many evacuees as we could.  We're very limited on what we can do for those without tents or trailers/RVs, but at least takes some of the burden off of the elementary school and other safe zones.  I met a lot of distraught people who lost their homes yesterday.  There were planes and helicopters dropping water and retardant for hours yesterday, but this shit traveled so fast and was still under 0% containment when I went to bed around 5 AM this morning.\n\nSome of my friends have lost their homes.  One of my son's coaches lost her ranch.  My friends' parents lost everything.  We're a humble community and many people have had to work so hard for so little and now it's all gone.  It's going to be extremely hard, if not impossible, for many of these people to recover.  The community as a whole is devastated and it's going to be a real struggle.  A large portion of the community is without power and we have been without cell phone service since yesterday evening throughout the valley.  Thankfully AT&T is installing temporary towers at this very moment so we can at least try to stay in touch with our loved ones.  I haven't heard of any deaths so far, but a lot of people have been unaccounted for because communication has been nearly impossible and many roads have been shut down.\n\nSorry for all of the rambling.  This is one of the most devastating fires we have ever experienced in our little valley and it's a lot to take in.  I expect to have to sift through a lot of ashes and debris in the upcoming days once the closures and evacuations are lifted.\n\n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;\n\n#Finding Loved Ones, Updates, Misc.\n\nIf you know someone in the area and have not been able to get ahold of them, you can try visiting [Red Cross Safe & Well](https://safeandwell.communityos.org/zf/safesearch/search) or following \\#ErskineFire on Facebook.  For local updates, you can search for Kern County Fire Department's Facebook page or \\#ErskineFire on Twitter.  Most of us still don't have cell phone service and internet is very limited to those who don't have satellite connections, so don't be too concerned yet if you haven't heard from anyone.\n\nEDIT:  It looks like there have been 2 confirmed deaths.  I don't know if their names have been released yet.  I won't be able to update very frequently, but I'll add new information below when I can.\n\n**2:06 PM** - If anyone cares, my grandma's house is okay and she was able to go back home.  The fire mostly left her area alone, thankfully.  The hospital was also just barely missed, so my mom is over there right now (she's an RN there).\n\n**3:19 PM** - Added more info above about donations and how to stay updated.\n\n**3:53 PM** - People from Tehachapi donated a large amount of goods for the victims.  I'll try to get some pictures posted, but first, I'm going to see if I can find out why this post was removed.\n\n**4:14 PM** - While I wait to find out why my post was removed, here is a small album of pictures from the generous people in Tehachapi: http://imgur.com/a/18RC5\n\n**4:49 PM** - Valley Estates over in the Kelso Valley area is being advised to evacuate.  The fire hasn't reached them, but the winds and embers are a concern.  Someone reported that firefighters cannot leave the area and a transport vehicle is on fire.\n\n**5:38 PM** - The hospital is in the process of being evacuated.  Those with respiratory issues were evacuated earlier and now everyone else is being evacuated because they don't have water and they can't get supplies in there.  No word yet on where they are taking everyone.  They have a lot of older patients in hospice care, so I hope they'll be able to transfer them to a suitable facility.\n\n**7:04 PM** - Well, I'm heading up to Kernville now to drop off food and supplies at the elementary school and then help out at the campground.  Hopefully this comment will become public again soon.  Internet is really spotty up there and I likely won't be able to update very regularly.\n\n**6/26 4:34 AM** - And we're back!  Thank you, mods, for re-approving my comment.  I need to go to bed soon, but I wanted to let everyone know that we have been receiving tons of donations from surrounding cities.  Ridgecrest has been especially helpful and their residents and businesses (even Walmart!) have been sending literal truckloads of supplies for displaced families.  This is only a small sample of what has come our way so far: http://imgur.com/a/YfioZ.  That doesn't even show all of the stuff that we received on Friday and started distributing amongst our refugees as well as the evacuation sites and various neighborhoods.  On a sadder note: approximately 36,000 acres have burned at this time and about 200 homes are known to have been destroyed.  I keep running into more and more people who are now homeless, including some that I know personally.  This has been tough for everyone, but with the generosity of residents from Bakersfield, Tehachapi, Ridgecrest, and even all the way over in Las Vegas, our community is hopeful that we'll somehow manage to recover.  This will likely be my last update, at least for a while, unless I actually get any requests for more information."}, {"body": "[deleted]"}, {"body": "**/r/HellscapePorn**"}, {"body": "I never in my life expected to see my hometown on the front page of Reddit.

I ran over and started to assess the baby's airway, his lips were blue but I tilted his head back then gave small compressions with my fingers, not really sure what to do. Luckily enough he started coughing soon after and as I was trying to turn him to a recovery position, police showed up and the whole scene got very loud. I don't really remember a lot, I think I was in shock. Just people screaming, and the mother screaming at me, and the police officer and the mother both reaching and trying to take the baby back from me soon after it began coughing up water. The scene was so loud and hysterical that I wasn't sure what to do, so I just sort of wandered back to my car in a daze. Nobody said anything to me that I remember. I called the nearby hospital about an hour later and gave a description and was told the baby was okay. \n\nNo tip for that delivery, but definitely made for one of the more interesting summer jobs I ever had. \n\nEdit: thank you, kind stranger, for my first Reddit gold!"}, {"body": "I can't imagine the situation where he gets the tip like that.

Also lets remember, \"I don't like his policies\" is not a reason for impeachment. \n\nAssuming this all happens, democrats run the 2018 elections and somehow swing the house and senate, even if he is impeached, it's extremely unlikely he is found guilty during trial at the senate.

The Trump Administration will embrace the shale oil and gas revolution to bring jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans. We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own. We will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure. Less expensive energy will be a big boost to American agriculture, as well.  \n  \nYes, let's get busy fracking all over the place.

In a few years China will be leading the clean energy revolution, making massive profits selling their technology around the globe, while we're sitting here in the old USofA, finding new and better ways to suck dead dinosaur juice out of the ground while more and more people are dying from cancer.  \n  \n>Lastly, our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment. Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority. President Trump will refocus the EPA on its essential mission of protecting our air and water.  \n  \nBWAHAHAHAHA OMG WTF all of THAT above talking about scrapping regulations which aim to improve our air and water quality and then THIS? **REFOCUS THE EPA???** FFS, how? By putting in charge a bought-and-paid-for shill for the fossil fuel industry?

A man who as Oklahoma AG, has sued the EPA repeatedly over, among other things, laws requiring lower mercury emissions from power plants. Seriously?  \n  \n>A brighter future depends on energy policies that stimulate our economy, ensure our security, and protect our health. Under the Trump Administration\u2019s energy policies, that future can become a reality.  \n\nThese policies will do none of the above. Our economy will stagnate and fall behind as the rest of the world gets over its addiction to oil. Our security will suffer as climate change accelerates - our own military has said as much.

I loved so many things about him and would like to share some of these things with you all. Many of these are likely to be repeated elsewhere in the thread.\n\n* His over 60 years in the business included over 200 films - notably including Dracula, the Star Wars prequels, and the Lord of the Rings/the Hobbit.\n* Before becoming an actor, he was a member of the British SAS and later a member of Winston Churchill's 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', an elite team within the SAS. \n* He was the only member of the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit cast to actually meet J. R. R. Tolkien. \n* During the filming of LotR, Peter Jackson tried to coach him on the sound to make when Saruman is stabbed. Lee informed him that he was well aware how a man reacted upon being stabbed from first hand experience.\n* He was a frequent golfing partner of James Bond creator Ian Fleming and was allegedly one of Fleming's biggest inspirations in creating the Bond character. Lee was Fleming's personal choice for the role of Dr. No in the first Bond film, and while Lee didn't end up playing Dr. No, he did later play Francisco Scaramanga in The Man With the Golden Gun.\n* At 6 feet 5 inches, he held the Guinness World Record for tallest leading actor.\n* His operatic bass voice and taste for metal saw him collaborate with Rhapsody of Fire (one of my favourite bands of all time) as a narrator on four of their albums and in a duet on the track The Magic of the Wizard's Dream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z93SdirnzTw\n* He later released his own metal album \"Charlemagne: By the Sword and the Cross\". \n* He became the oldest living performer to enter the music charts with his song Jingle Hell, one of the singles from his \"A Heavy Metal Christmas Too\" EP (one of his two metal Christmas EPs, because of course).\n\nI feel like I could write for hours. While I'm saddened by the loss of a great man, I feel that we as a world can count ourselves lucky that a man of Lee's calibre walked amongst us for 93 years and gave so much of himself to his passions and to the arts. \n\nVale Christopher Lee, 1922-2015."}, {"body": "What a life, this is heartbreaking news.
