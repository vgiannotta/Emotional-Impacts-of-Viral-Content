Dignity develops the individuals mind, and their character. Dignity teaches people to cultivate the following traits:  self-control, self-sacrifice, self-lessness, gaining control over  emotions, dependability, personal accountability for your thoughts words and actions, congruency in thoughts, words and actions, (to think what you feel, say what you think, and do what you say); courage to face fears, humility to face flaws, integrity, to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done, (rain or shine, regardless of how you feel), to favor what's is needed over what is wanted, to do what's is difficult when it needs to be done, to not make excuses, to be calm assertive, to always be willing to say yes, and always able to say no, to be able to give and take, to be punctual, to have self-restrain, self- respect, and to treat others with equal respect, to set and follow strict guidelines boundaries and limitations, to stick by your word, to put yourself last, after everyone else is taken care of (selflessness/self-sacrifice), efficiency, sustainability, simplicity, moderation/temperance, gets to the root of things, the ability to lead by example, the ability to selflessly lead others, the ability to administer the\nrepercussions for any violations of the mutually agreed upon rules, the ability to state intent with absolute clarity and in no uncertain terms, the ability to administer tough love/lay down the law, etc. \n\nThese are all masculine qualities. And they are all rooted in dignity. Whoever puts dignity before their own feelings, and desires will cultivate these masculine traits naturally. \n\nFemininity is rooted in love. Love develops the individuals heart. Love teaches people to cultivate the following traits: self-expression, individuality, creativity,  compassion, emotions, tenderness, the ability to determine and to discover who they are, communication, intuition, empathy, liberatiin/freedom, openness,  boundlessness, the ability to give, charity, stand up for the underdog, the ability to forgive/show mercy. Femininity at it's apex is the cultivation of unconditional love. This requires self-sacrifice. So, it begins with self-expression, and eventually reaches self-sacrifice upon reaching  its apex of unconditional love. Whereas, the love in which they have for others becomes superior to any needs or desires of the self.  \n\nThese are all feminine qualities and they are all rooted in love (Unconditional love at it's apex). \n\nThe more a man develops himself in dignity, the more a women will become naturally feminized in his presence. Bcuz, a women  will feel safe, secure, protective, honest, congruent embrace from his dignified masculine presence. This will allow her to feel at ease, whereas she can move into her vulnerable feminine nature. This builds up tension of polarization. This vast polarized chasm builds tremendous attraction between the polarized sexes. The more rooted in dignity the man is, the more dignified masculinity he will eminate. The more dignified masculine a man is, the more a women will become naturally feminized; and the greater the attraction potential. \nA women in the presence of a man who is truly rooted in dignity, the more she will feel safe n secure enough to put her own guard down, n put her faith and trust in him, and his dignified leadership. This is how, and why a women submits to man. She submits not to the man's ego, but to the selfless man whose life is governed not by his own, but by dignity itself. \n\nThis is based upon Christian principles. Whereas, God is Perfect dignity. The very source of dignity itself. And, a man who is guided by God, is guided by perfect dignity. This is the nature of God \"the Father\". He teaches males to become men of dignity. While Jesus teaches in the ways of unconditional love."}, {"topLevelComment": "I love this guy.

I have Aspergers, so it is slightly more mild than normal autism, but that brings about many of its own challenges as well. For me it feels like living in the grey area between being normal and being quintessentially \"weird\". I often find that it is hard to fit in with anyone, even the people one would expect someone with autism/ASD to fit into, because I just don't relate to them, or anyone for that matter. For this reason I spend most of my days, if not all, by myself in my room as my room and my PC in that room are the two places where I can find solace and comfort in. Its easier when you have full on autism, in a sense, because at least most people will know it. Having Aspergers is like being unintentionally awkward almost all the time, weirding and in cases creeping people out because of how you act. They don't know you have it, they just see you as \"weird\", a term I hate so much."}, {"topLevelComment": "1 in 88 wow i\u2019m special"}, {"topLevelComment": "My mother has exact same name!!!

We take pride in our indoor housing and the level of enrichment and care to keep them happy and healthy. \n\nThe calf will weigh around 150lb and will be about 6' tall at birth.\nThe front hooves will come out first followed by the snout.\n\nMom will naturally raise the calf, with weaning could take between 6-10 months, maybe longer.  We will not rush this process \u2013 it is just a documented range of captive weaning. \n\nOnce the calf is born, we will have a contest to name it.\n\nThe keepers will go in with April, clean her pen, give her treats (but not Oliver).  He is a bull - and a bull is a bull is a bull!\n\nGiraffes are pregnant for 15 months\n\nUpon naturally weaning, the calf will move on to another facility to start a breeding program there.  We cannot retain offspring, as it would lead to incestuous mating and undermine the genetics of the program and species.  \n\nThose \"things\" on their heads are called ossicones.\n\nBulls (male giraffes) only really care about two things- fighting and the unmentionable....\nOliver may share space with April, but for short periods.  Bulls take no part in rearing young. \n\nThey eat hay and specialized giraffe diet but love romaine lettuce and carrot treats. \n\nApril's water source, enrichment, and solo hay feeder are out of sight of the camera view.\n\nThis is Animal Adventure's first giraffe calf.\n -------------------------------------", "viewCount": "1130952", "likeCount": "5520", "dislikeCount": "571", "commentCount": "374", "comments": [{"topLevelComment": "\u0440\u043a\u0442\u0443\u043e"}, {"topLevelComment": "Thank you, Mazuri!

Churches are not allowed and non-Buddhists are not privy to the same benefits such as free education. Proselytism and incitement to convert are illegal. Bhutanese who converts to Christianity risk losing their citizenship.

Maybe this generation doesn\u2019t care that 50,000 Americans die every year in cars (but I say more), and maybe that\u2019s because our population loves their cars more than life. But God is life. Satan is death."}, {"topLevelComment": "The other day somebody on my left put signals going to the right into the road I came from, but drove forward."}, {"topLevelComment": "So the main problem with all of this \"driverless car\" discussion is again, this is a company selling you product, hype and general BS so you get excited about _buying_ something. The real big problems with driverless cars - ARE NOT SOLVED. And you only need to see Googles own final report of its own driverless car - its only practical in small, closed, well mapped areas.\nThe problems:\n- Almost all poor road conditions, driverless cars are NOT good at dealing with. From snow, fog, rain, dust and just dirt roads. Not suitable.\n- Almost _all_ driverless cars are relying on only the cars sensors to determine traffic - this will NOT improve safety. The car will need to make life/death decisions the same way a person will.\n- Legally there is no precedence for when a driverless car kills a bunch of pedestrians. This isnt 'if' this is 'when'. Mechanics and Electronics fail over time and this means you will have severe accidents.\n- Who insures the AI - Is the owner responsible? Is the car maker responsible? Is the government responsible? When the above happens.. who pays? This is a big and long topic this one, and it is rarely addressed because gov, insurance companies and car makers dont want the ownership - guess who will be responsible?\n- The tech is NOT here yet. I have been working with autonomous vehicle sensors and simulators and the industry is all lying to you saying that Teslas are safe and driverless cars are safe - they are not, and it will be a good decade before proper safety mechanisms are in place. Until then, many people will be hurt.\n- LiDar is a joke. At best. And the new Radar sensors are not much better. For example, different Lidar makers sensors actually interfere with each other - you get weird responses and bad data. This is a _major_ concern but again, few people talk about it.\n- If driverless cars occur, it will _increase_ travel time. Most people dont understand this, but its simple. If everyone can \"not drive\" to work or where they want to go, then there is no need for public transport and mass transit. So, all the people that _dont_ currently drive, will. The highways and roads will be flooded and you will take much longer to get anywhere. Cities will be worst hit because its only mass transit systems that help move high densities of people. Cars will reduce the densities by magnitudes and cause huge issues.\nThere are many more issues too, but these are the main ones. Dont just believe the hype..  these systems need to be well thought out, and we are not doing some basic engineering."}, {"topLevelComment": "mey yoyarecool   volgkkt.ru\nwe worked worked mid edu sdt"}, {"topLevelComment": "If you have this kind of car, does it mean that you don't need a drivers license?

Still tragic to be sure, but nowhere near 34 as he claims.  Now using the 1.2 million worldwide number does work out to 34 for the entirety of his speech.

Others, such as Tesla have even more scenarios where stationary objects confuse the systems and cause wrong responses.

Here's a recap of what\u2019s happened since then.\n\n*YouTube Creator Studio:* Since the app\u2019s launch in June, you\u2019ve checked millions of comments and real time channel stats on the go. Our latest version of the Creator Studio app is optimized for Android, iPad and iPhone and we\u2019re continuously working to make it better. http://goo.gl/5s4GaF\n\n*High Frame Rate:* Now you can upload HD videos at 48, 50 and 60 frames per second and we\u2019ll play them back for your fans at the same frame rate. Intense motion is smoother and epic battles are epic-er (just make sure you\u2019re watching in HD). HFR playback is now available on desktop and PS4 and we're working to roll it out on mobile soon. Stay tuned! http://goo.gl/vHdgHC\n\n*Fan Funding:* Since we introduced the Fan Funding beta, many viewers have used Fan Funding to show their love for their favorite creators. In the next couple of weeks we'll enable Fan Funding for even more creators. http://goo.gl/hkDHpL\n\n*Creator Credits:* So many of you use your video descriptions to credit the other creators who helped make your video\u00a0awesome. Now you can\u00a0take your shout-outs one step further. Use Creator Credits to highlight your collaborators\u2019 roles, like actor or director, and even allow viewers to subscribe to their channel from your watch page. Creator Credits are available to channels with more than 10K subscribers, and we\u2019ll expand to more channels soon. http://goo.gl/4UeYqB\n\n*Audio Library:* Every video deserves a great soundtrack. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been adding even more songs and sound effects for you to use for free, forever, in our Audio Library, available at youtube.com/audiolibrary\n\n*Cards:* We completely re-imagined how annotations could work better in more places. Cards emphasize your video content above all, while enabling further interaction across desktop and mobile. We\u2019ll start rolling out Cards in December and they\u2019ll be widely available next year.\u00a0\n\n*Subtitles contributed by fans:* Right now, we\u2019re working on making fan subtitles simpler and faster for you and your fans to use, and we look forward to expanding the beta to more people. http://goo.gl/au4JzX", "reply": "Just want to say Thanks for the improvements ..\u00a0"}, {"topLevelComment": "#bringbackeleventhgorgeous"}, {"topLevelComment": "I was wondering why I was able to monetize a cover song I did just now, didn't know I could do that before.

Especially when main enemies have their own characteristics and personalities. It also relies heavily on clich\u00e9s from what I'm seeing.\u00a0Zombies, Crimson Heads, Hunters and Lickers were frightening because they had no emotional attachment to the world and they had only one life\u00a0motive, an instinct to kill. And you're mostly\u00a0alone with those monsters. Lickers were frightening because\u00a0they have no eyes\u00a0but they can hear you from far ahead. Hunters are basically predators, they're fast, agile and are tough to deal with if you're low on ammo. Crimson Heads are abominations that you don't want to deal with if you shoot down the zombies. What remake does right and why I think is still\u00a0the best RE game to this day is that the game throws you a curveball from time to time, and what\u00a0makes it\u00a0superior to the original is that it adds extra challenge. It doesn't just rely on\u00a0cheap jump scares but it almost has an urge to fuck with you.\u00a0You actually don't know what\u00a0to expect since you're dealing with lifeless monstrosities with no personality of their own and they live only by killer's instinct. I don't know but I'm not really terrified by the hillbilly family that came out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And I hope the ghost thing isn't a reality because it really doesn't fit the theme of the series. But the game still has potential so we'll see. I just hope the replay value and speedrun will be available\u00a0in RE7 because almost all of them have them. I just hope that RE2 remake doesn't go FPS route because that would definitely be a total betrayal to the original game and I would be better of playing Darkside Chronicles.
