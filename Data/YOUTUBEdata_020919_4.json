During a rescue mission in space, Jean is nearly killed when she is hit by a mysterious cosmic force. Once she returns home, this force not only makes her infinitely more powerful, but far more unstable. Wrestling with this entity inside her, Jean unleashes her powers in ways she can neither comprehend nor contain. With Jean spiraling out of control, and hurting the ones she loves most, she begins to unravel the very fabric that holds the X-Men together. Now, with this family falling apart, they must find a way to unite -- not only to save Jean's soul, but to save our very planet from aliens who wish to weaponize this force and rule the galaxy.\n\nIn Theaters June 7, 2019\n\nWritten and Directed by: Simon Kinberg\n\nProduced by: Simon Kinberg, Hutch Parker, Lauren Shuler Donner, Todd Hallowell\n\nCast: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan, Alexandra Shipp, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Evan Peters, and Jessica Chastain\n\nConnect with Dark Phoenix Online:\nVisit the Dark Phoenix WEBSITE: http://www.DarkPhoenix.com\nLike Dark Phoenix on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/xmenmovies/\nFollow Dark Phoenix on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/xmenmovies\nFollow Dark Phoenix on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/xmenmovies/\n\n#DarkPhoenix \n\nAbout 20th Century FOX:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

And yes, It is complete nonsense that talent doesn't matter. Talent is like having legs, when you do not have legs it is difficult to kneel or to run. The fact that someone says that you do not have talent doesn't say anything about you having talent or not. What are the criteria of the observer to come to this conclusion? There's a story that Einstein didn't speak when he was young, so several people made the conclusion that he was not smart enough to speak. Wrong conclusion.\r\nSaying that talent doesn't exist is the same as saying all our brains are the same and experience in the past did had no influence on the development of our brain abilities.\n\r\nHe comes with several success stories... but for each of the success stories we can find a thousand or more failings.\r\n\rAnd let's look at his own story: he claims that he didn't know any Chinese and learned it in only 6 months. That statement would only be real when he was planning to go to Africa to see lions and elephants. So he bought a ticket for the safari, went into the plain and arrived in Beijing....he had no idea where he was and why the Africans did look so different as on the pictures.\nBut that is not how it went: he decided to go to China ...why? Why is not that important, but the moment he get interested in China he started with learning Chinese. A language is the vehicle to carry a culture.\r\nI cannot believe that he never read anything about Chine before, almost everybody know something about China which means that in our brains we have already formed some places and some connection related to China.\r Even when he wasn\u00b4t thinking about China but just about learning languages ...or learning in general, he was already busy with preparing to learn / in this case Chinese.\n\rHe's not a Kaspar Hauser! the child that grew up in the wood in a stable and never learned any human things.\n\r\nThe ability of learning a language is determined by the interests you did developed during the years and the different experiences you had. \nSince a lot of people do have a lot of other interests, or they might just be listening to music the whole day,  It is just not true what he is claiming, it only works for a very limited amount of people. Only for people who have been learning to learn. Not for everybody..\r\n\r\nSo whenever you try it and it doesn't work for you, there's nothing wrong with you. When you are 1.60 m it is difficult or impossible to reach 2.60. While when you are 2 meter and having some weight, it is difficult to sit comfortable on a stool of 10 cm high. We are not the same, we have other abilities so do not claim that everybody can do the same, when you do so you might be a good seller but just do not understand what teaching is."}, {"topLevelComment": "The principles are right very helpful and useful.\nI am trying to learn \u666e\u901a\u8bdd Mandarin Chinese. I have limited vocabulary and acquiring more every day.\nIf you look at the language to me it is more of a culture, We just don't think that way, Chinese is a descriptive language, Where English is one word one object one meaning. Some words in Chinese are very logical and make sense others most of them are Idioms that only natives truly know how to use, I'm not saying it can't be learnt though being in their environment helps to think that way.\nSo I think for example Mandarin Chinese will take a lot longer than a European language for an English speaker.\nOh did I mention Characters, Tone memory and word order..."}, {"topLevelComment": "Waryaa ii af yiiqano meshan"}, {"topLevelComment": "This man really made me a favor.

What is 'speaking a language fluently'? If it's about knowing how to do your shopping without being robbed, six months is fine. If it's studying in a university,    (that is, just listening and understanding), all depends on the language: a French will easily understand an English philosophy or maths or sciences teacher in six months because 70% of both elaborate vocabularies have latin roots - but he won't speak. If it's about getting a job as an executive in an office, three years at least. If it's about nobody knowing you're not a native speaker ... come on,\u00a0at least ten years. Because, even if your accent is perfect (feasible in four years), it takes eons to learn all the idioms and words a native speaker knows. \nThe main thing is : 'Do you really want to learn the language?' I mean, deep in your heart! If you're not in love with the language, you will always sound as a foreigner, even after 30 or 40 years.\u00a0So, immersion is not what makes you talk like a native speaker. Why so many foreign wives or husbands can't speak properly with their husbands or wives and kids after a dozen of years? Because, down in their heart (and maybe unconsciously), they don't want to. They want to keep their 'foreign' identity.\nWhat Chris Lonsdale is not talking about is music. Probably because he is not a musician? But for any musician, what is so obvious is that any language is made out of five 'parameters' : melody, accentuations, rhythms, phonemes and timber.\u00a0\nActually, any language can be written on a score, using the three first parameters. Once you know how to 'sing' the language (melody, accentuations and rhythms), you have to add the phonemes. Reading is the worse thing you can do because you're not focusing on listening and - very true - watching people faces and lips. Most adults learn the wrong way - by reading first.\u00a0You have to learn like a kid: this is why the violin Suzuki method is so efficient - it respects the learning steps of the child: hearing, listening, playing (talking), reading, and writing (if you want to become a composer).\nA four-year child doesn't know to read and write - nonetheless, he knows how to 'sing' his first language without any (foreign) accent. In only four years! He/she even doesn't know most of the vocabulary of his/her language. The right way to learn a language is to do it like a baby : hearing, then listening (because you start to realise, 'oh, they're talking about cookies'), then trying to imitate (to get the cookie). Once you get the cookie because your imitation was good, you've learnt two phonemes and a little melody. And you're now ready for the piece of chocolate - because you understood the same process has to be repeated to get that piece of chocolate.\nThis the way I did learn English when I was 22.\u00a0After one year, even if people spotted me right was as a foreigner because my vocabulary was limited, nobody could guess I was French. They thought I was Swedish or Dutch: I was very proud of not being spotted as a French!\u00a0All day long, I was 'singing' in my head what I was hearing - without taking any attention to the words, not trying to understand. I was an excellent  'piano player' - I was born with it, but now I wanted to become a 'saxophone player' because everybody was playing the saxophone around me! Wanting to understand too soon gets in the way of the process of learning how to 'sing'. Once you know how to 'sing', you have to work on your phonemes. Very true, you have to learn to use different muscles and forget you were a piano or tennis player. It's now all about saxophone or fencing or swimming - but it's still about music or sports - something you're already familiar with. Once you identified these 'new' muscles and spots in your mouth, adding phonemes on the 'score' comes quite easily. You just have to take attention to their place in regards to accentuations and rhythms.\nOne last thing : you also have to identify what makes you own first language sound like your language - and focus on erasing all these particularities.  I wanted so much to never sound like a French that I identified all the 'defaults' French speakers reproduce in their English, like adding ... eu at the end of words, or having no clue of what makes the English so swingy: its rhythm is ternary - like jazz, as French is binary - no swing. After four years, if the discussion was not too elaborate, nobody could guess I was not a native speaker. But if we started to speak about literature or arts or philosophy or politics, my lack of vocabulary was obvious. Same thing for my sister. An other thing that still betrays us today is when we ... swear: it comes so much more naturally in your own language - putain de bordel de merde!"}, {"topLevelComment": "15:10"}, {"topLevelComment": "Poor english even a whole life time learning \ud83e\udd23\nR.I.P my english"}, {"topLevelComment": "it's really ironic - as a video about fast learning he's very slow to get to the point of telling you about his learning tips. and I can tell you that he certainly does not sound like a native speaker when he speaks mandarin chinese."}, {"topLevelComment": "I want learning english and this video helps a lot !"}, {"topLevelComment": "Excelent!!!!"}, {"topLevelComment": "Why he yell"}, {"topLevelComment": "I know how to speak three languages fluently.

They might even get a kick out of turning the obsidian rocks(with metal additives or without) into an obsidian sword.\n\nI also think you should have used a metal core for the blade and handle rather than just straight up obsidian everything. The core of metal would allow for less of a chance for the handle to break(it would probably be easier to make the main body of the blade out of metal and make the edge of obsidian.

Also, honest people are at times uncomfortable people. Why? Have you ever had the experience of being told the truth and inwardly cringing instantly? You knew i was true but it was not nice to hear it, perhaps about some of your faults or misdeeds or even an honest opinion that was different from yours.

That means if you get to sleep 8 hours per day, you're likely been on the receiving end of about 12 lies per hour. According to one study found that over a one-week period, lies were detected in 37% of phone calls, 27% of face-to-face meetings, 21% of IM chats, and 14% of e-mails.

Reaction wheels mounted on three faces of the cube rotate at high angular velocities and then brake suddenly, causing the Cubli to jump up. Once the Cubli has almost reached the corner stand up position, controlled motor torques are applied to make it balance on its corner. In addition to balancing, the motor torques can also be used to achieve a controlled fall such that the Cubli can be commanded to fall in any arbitrary direction. Combining these three abilities -- jumping up, balancing, and controlled falling -- the Cubli is able to 'walk'.\n\nLead Researchers: Gajamohan Mohanarajah and Raffaello D'Andrea\n\nThis work was done at the Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control, ETH Zurich, Switzerland and was funded in part by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), grant number 146717.\n\nFor more details visit: http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/Research_DAndrea/Cubli\n\nOther links:\nhttp://robohub.org/swiss-robots-cubli-a-cube-that-can-jump-up-balance-and-walk-across-your-desk/\nhttp://youtu.be/bMuCACqwI4s (Zurich.Minds talk on Cubli)", "viewCount": "11142353", "likeCount": "118327", "dislikeCount": "2512", "commentCount": "6138", "comments": [{"topLevelComment": "oh so thats how that purple cube from fortnite works"}, {"topLevelComment": "shut up and take my money"}, {"topLevelComment": "Weebles wobble but they don't fall down"}, {"topLevelComment": "Man, people that have not done dynamics or worked with polar coordinates do not know how ridiculously difficult it would be to program..."}, {"topLevelComment": "WUT"}, {"topLevelComment": "Others..

Cialdini\r\n\r\nThis is interesting, Cialdini writes, \"What I'm talking about is pre-suasion, directing their minds to the moment before they experience the content. There's this interesting study. A guy goes to a shopping mall in France. And he tries to get women's phone numbers as they pass various shops so he could call for a date. But in neither of those cases was he very successful. He only got a number 13% of the time. But there was one kind of shop that doubled his success rate when women were passing it, a flower shop. Why? Because flowers put women in the mindset of romance.\" Wow! I love to learn psychology and the human mind. When I listened to Les Brown, my favorite motivational speaker, he had a list of books he recommended. Top 10 on his list was this book, which was a really fascinating and enlightening read. It reminds me why being a skeptic and a cynic sometimes are so valuable and necessary \u2013 particularly in today's world.\r\n\r\nTo READ my REVIEW, just CLICK HERE: https://www.richardangelus.me/2018/09/influence-psychology-of-persuasion-2006.html"}, {"topLevelComment": "i feel like all drug dealers watch this because i swear to god some dealers can scam you blind if ur not careful."}, {"topLevelComment": "Fabulous information.

A new trailer, images and poster are now available. The trailer features Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, Finley Hobbins and Nico Parker.\n\nCircus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) enlists former star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) and his children Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins) to care for a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him a laughingstock in an already struggling circus. But when they discover that Dumbo can fly, the circus makes an incredible comeback, attracting persuasive entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), who recruits the peculiar pachyderm for his newest, larger-than-life entertainment venture, Dreamland. Dumbo soars to new heights alongside a charming and spectacular aerial artist, Colette Marchant (Eva Green), until Holt learns that beneath its shiny veneer, Dreamland is full of dark secrets.\n\nWebsite: https://disney.com/dumbo\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/disneymovietrailers\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyDumbo/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dumbo\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dumbo/\n\nU.S. Release Date:  March 29, 2019\nCast:  Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, Alan Arkin, Finley Hobbins, Nico Parker.\nDirector:  Tim Burton\nProducers:  Justin Springer, Ehren Kruger, Katterli Frauenfelder, Derek Frey\nScreenplay by: Ehren Kruger\nExecutive Producer: Nigel Gostelow", "viewCount": "10557581", "likeCount": "205806", "dislikeCount": "9633", "commentCount": "20344", "comments": [{"topLevelComment": "What quality, Disney.

I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.\n\nNotes about measuring radiation:\nSieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.\n\nObviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.\nhttps://xkcd.com/radiation/\n\nDOSES MAY VARY\nThe level of radiation varies widely around the world depending mainly on altitude and geology (excluding nuclear accidents).\n\nEstimates of particular doses also vary.

I bought an ipod cause i was funneled into the itunes store when it was all proliferating,\u00a0 it was essier at the time. I bought an imac (flat screen thing) because it looked\u00a0 cool (screen and pc all in one item..that was great) not because i wanted to belong to the apple tribe or creative set.\n\nIve always had a HTC phone or recently a samsung phone. Reasons are:\n\n1: precisely because i had not been influenced by thier marketing, i like the objectivity of just comparing specs.\n\nSo i couldnt tell you THIER\u00a0 'why'. Once the first\u00a0 phone proved itself MY 'why' for buying again was that it was a stable effective fun durable state of the art device. Apple's marketing\u00a0 is so pervasive that if i considered thier product i felt like i was getting suckered into apples advertising so theyre 'why' was a turn off cause i felt it was just advertising hyperbole.\n\n2: a high percentage\u00a0 of people\u00a0 with apple phones had smashed screens..so not great endorsement for living the dream there. Plus the first few iterations looked old and small before they seemed to copy HTC and then they looked like all the others anyway. Incidentally HTC have been on the decline since apple seemed to rip off theyre design look. Theyre marketing gobbles up all the air space just like it did when they outmarketed every other mp3 when they ejaculated\u00a0 iPods. Not unlike the movie avatar. It was a good movie but it was so UNbelievably heavily marketed\u00a0 for so long before release - a huge number of people found it inescapable and other movies got far less than normal attention (because theyre marketing efforts were so prolific)\n\nAnd 3: im not a sheep..it gets reported\u00a0 that some fools que up for days sleeping on the streets\u00a0 to buy this stuff.\u00a0 That's just socially retardulous.

What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. \n\nPART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM\n\nSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"", "viewCount": "9486140", "likeCount": "59458", "dislikeCount": "1920", "commentCount": "8321", "comments": [{"topLevelComment": "beside agreeing if its moral or not at time 48:45 saying that having no  children make the murder more moral is not accurate.If we look at it from a biological perspective they had spreed there genes/DNA so it could be less moral to kill the one with no kids.... i couldn't agree or disagree if what was done is moral or not because i'm not able to imagine what would i do in this case specifically if some one sacrificed himself or naturally died even if i could eat somebody .Also not being able know the mental health and physical need after 20 day without food.As for the car example it is much easier to judge."}, {"topLevelComment": "Axiomatic certainties in the course of philosophical musings are fine.

I will tell you my thinking process.\n1: Trolly car driver -  Here it comes down to choosing between 5 or 1 and it's only feasible opting for one person. Our aim is to have as little casualties as possible. There is no moral dilemma here.\n2: Onlooker near fatman - In this case, you want to save the five, but don t want to kill the innocent man in front of you, regardless of whether he is fat, ugly or whatever. That is completely irrelevant here. But there is another option that no one mentioned. We should be the ones jumping under the trolley and saving the 5. The second option would be pushing the fat man, and the last one not doing anything. There are some moral obligations and convictions that should guide us in our lives ... But it s a totally different thing talking about it in the Harvard hall, or me writing it on the computer, than actually being in the situation. Sacrificing oneself is the most moral thing here, not even being considered by tehse people.\n3: Doctor with 6 patients -  In this case, a doctor should tend to those who are in the most dire need first,  irrespective of the fact that there were 5 who could die at the same time. This is a fundamental ethics of ours - saving the weakest person first. If you don t manage to save the others, it s a shame, but you did what was right.\n4: Doctor with 5 patients and a possible \"victim donor\"  - you cannot just murder someone and justify it by saving others. The highest moral code is not murdering someone. If you had to choose between 1 and 5, you would choose 1, as was the case in our first example. The difference here is a blood on your hands and a huge burden upon your shoulders for the rest of your life. You can t take that because it goes against you moral value system. ANd this system is above everything else.\n5. 1 ailing guy being killed by other 3 sailors - the solutions with lottery and such things are out of question. That s just ou of question and I won t explain why because it seems completely unreasonable. YOu can t just kill someone to save your ass. In that very moment, you are probably not thinking about saving the others, but rather about saving yourself. The right thing to do is to abstain from any action. Again, due to the moral system that you hold and this system is above everything else. I mean, who are we to say that some should live and one shouldn t. If we die, we die together, no matter what. That is something what distinguishes a man from a beast. Again, you can propose to die yourself. That s also possible here, but killing the other is a thinking that lead us to many wars and is still leading us to wars.\n\nWhat I m basically saying is that self-serving approach is not the right approach. YOu cannot sacrifice someone for the \"greater\" good. If you did it for the greater good, it would be ok even, but let s be real, everyone in such situations starts thinking about saving their fuucking asses. If we dismissed such self-serving thoughts, we would make the right decision, regardless of the outcome.", "reply": "In the second case, pushing that fat man comes after killing 5.

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)", "viewCount": "9419634", "likeCount": "149111", "dislikeCount": "5728", "commentCount": "9923", "comments": [{"topLevelComment": "I really like his voice!!!!! \ud83d\ude02"}, {"topLevelComment": "Portuguese: Brazilian flag\n\n\n\n\n\nPRESS F FOR PORTUGAL"}, {"topLevelComment": "I had a shower conversation this morning\n\nThen I realized that it was five-thirty AM and I was loudly talking to myself in Spanish"}, {"topLevelComment": "13:55  Awesome !!"}, {"topLevelComment": "Without these techniques you can't learn to speak any language...
