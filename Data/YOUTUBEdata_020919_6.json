Dr. Sarah Hallberg provides compelling evidence that it can, and the solution is simpler than you might think.\n\nDr. Sarah Hallberg is the Medical Director of the Medically Supervised Weight Loss Program at IU Health Arnett, a program she created. She is board certified in both obesity medicine and internal medicine and has a Master\u2019s Degree in Exercise Physiology. She has recently created what is only the second non-surgical weight loss rotation in the country for medical students. Her program has consistently exceeded national benchmarks for weight loss, and has been highly successful in reversing diabetes and other metabolic diseases.

If you do you might know that not all patients get the same medication dose or the same number of medications. Some patients of high blood pressure can get better by just lifestyle changes (like exercise, losing weight) or very minor medications. Some of the patients need two three or ever five or six medications. \r\nJust like blood pressure diabetes cannot be boxed into one small box. Wish I had time to explain this in detail. \r\nA crazy statement, diabetes is not a condition of high sugar intake but lack of, ineffective or resistance to INSULIN. Someone can have a complete absence of insulin (as in type 1 diabetes) but others have varying degrees of deficiency or resistance of insulin. Thus trying to tell a type one diabetic to take keto LCHF diet and his diabetes will be criminal if a doctor said it. I will personally take them to court as it will cause the death of the person. \r\n\r\nA person with mild resistance or deficiency of insulin may get better by the diet (partly by losing weight) but you can prescribe the same treatment for the higher grades of the disease. \r\n\r\nActually, if a person stops medications or insulin (if they really need it) will result in a condition called ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma and result in patient death. And you will ask how do I know because I as a physician have seen many such deaths over the last 25 years of my carrier."}, {"topLevelComment": "People say this is not sustainable.

This is utter foolishness. \n\n   Sugar is the combination of glucose and fructose. \n\n If fructose is added to glucose, part of the glucose is converted into sugar and as such  the volume of glucose should come down.\n\nTake for example common salt.\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\nBy measuring sodium, no one can ever say it is sodium chloride (salt).  If you add chlorine to sodium the volume of sodium decreases. \n\nSame way if oxygen is added to hydrogen, part of hydrogen will be converted into water and as such volume of hydrogen will decrease.\n\n   \nBy keeping those points in mind you can treat and cure  any diabetic person without medicines.\n\nHIGH BP AND DIABETICS ARE THE SELF HEALING PROCESS OF HUMAN BODY AND AS SUCH NEVER TRY TO CONTROL IT THROUGH MEDICATION.\n\nIf you act against the self healing process our body retaliates and as such never do that mistake.\n\nHigh BP is for your good. As such you should help the body to increase the BP.\n\nIN SHORT YOU SHOULD INCREASE THE BP. If not agreed, medical science will be bound to expose this scam after another ten years.\n\n=============\n\nAnother foolishness by medical science is the measurement of FASTING SUGAR.\n\nIf a diabetic person  keeps  fasting for two days, and there after measure the  fasting glucose,  the glucose level will remain high. ?!.  \n\nMedical science has utter confusion and due to this ignorance they try to control fasting sugar through medication.\n\nThe FSATING SUGAR remains high why because our liver is trying to drain out excess glucose. This is the self healing process of liver. \n\nIf you stop this process through medication will lead to fatty liver or liver cerosis.\n\n      When our  liver is tries to drain out excess glucose from the body.  How can it be a disease ?\n\nSame way \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nOur  body is creates high blood pressure to push blood through partially squeezed/blocked  blood vessels.\n\nHow can it be a disease.???\n\nSTROKE OCCURES DUE TO DISRUPTION OF BLOOD FLOW THROUGH BRAIN.\nWho ever has brain should accept this fact.\n\nNow our body tries to push blood by creating high pressure.\n\nHIGH BP AND BLOOD SUGAR CAN BE BROUT UNDER CONTROL WITHOUT MEDICATION.\n\nNaturopathy treatments are doing good and the blood glucose level comes down during their treatment. \n\n Theoratically they are not able convince the public, due to which the patients are  back in square one.\n\n=====================\nIF THE FASTING SUGAR (glucose) IS HIGH IN UR BODY, PROCEED AS FOLLOWS.\n======================\n\n1. High glucose got accumulated through excess intake of high carb food.\n\n2.  The medication has forcibly hidden glucose in the body.\n\nREMEDY \n\nIf bitterguard (Karela) juice is added in sugar solution, the sweetness of sugar solution goes off.\n\nWhere as if a diabetic patient drink karela juice the blood glucose level remain unchanged .\n\nThis shows karela juice cannot react with glucose, and hence blood glucose is not blood sugar.\n\n  \u27a1 The person who has high fasting sugar should eat plenty of low glycemic fruits.\nThus the blood glucose gets converted into sugar.  \n\nThe excess sugar thus formed can be drained out through urine  by excess intake of water.\n\nKeep in mind..... the excess salt and excess sugar is drained out from body through urine.\n\n\u27a1 once the sugar is formed in body, this can be neutralised by drinking bitterguard juice.\n\nPlease criticise me and/or  forward your comments.\n\nPlease share.

And I am still not sure if it's for me.\n\nNow I'd like to share my experience now that you know I am not inclined to believe anything easily.I live next to a practicing witch she's does work for people has attacked me for 30 years.But I'm still here.One day I was watching a T.V. show about a white woman with green eyes pale skin who got involved with the mafia.I noticed she looked a lot like me.She got killed by these mafia people, they found her cut in half in a field not one drop of blood.I sensed immediately and this doesn't happen to me everyday, a finger like touch on my right side of my body and it passed itself all past my stomach to the left side.Like a spirit touching me.I knew it was some warning that what happened to her could happen to me.I knew if there was a possibility it was because of my neighbor's constant witchcraft.(I have been forced to accept the reality of dark magic).\n\n Anyway right after all that honest to God the screen changed the documentary was gone and an interference came in but I changed channels to see if the T.V. jumped from one channel to another but no, so I returned to the channel. Suddenly I saw on the screen a lizard like face I will never forget it, I was very focused on the right side of the screen where I meet with an eye it was lightest green and I said to myself this is not a movie but I had a strange calm, the eye was staring at me and I could tell quickly this was a person with very high intelligence.The look was just like looking into the eyes of a genius I could tell this person knew me had a deep penetrating stare.I don't know why I wasn't scared I had already noticed the eye looked human but the skin reptilian the color green was light too and in the creases there were very fine red veins running all over the face.All this took some long seconds but I want to break it down slowly as I lived it. I decided to find the other eye assuming that it was a human like lizard with a face similar to a man's, but as I went on searching for the eye on other side I came across the spot where another eye should have been, there was nothing! This is when I started to get nervous so I kept looking went further, this was a big screen T.V.  not the biggest but large, finally I got to the the other eye and realized it was more like a dragon!!! I was just about to let out the loudest scream when immediately the dragon disappeared and regular programming resumed.\n\nI stayed in shock I didn't tell my mother in the next room.I put it out of my mind for a few years.Then I recalled it from time to time in disbelief I finally accepted that when I use to laugh at the retards who talked about reptilians they were not are not sick or foolish people after all. I don't care what anyone yells at me I know what I saw. IT'S REAL. I think these reptilian are of the devil, evil spiritual beings that live in a dimension we can't see they influence us for evil.God in His infinite mercy allowed me to see for myself who that witch works with and their intention.You know what they say knowing is winning half the battle.That's my reality and I'm sticking to it.Thanks for reading."}, {"topLevelComment": "big book = definitely true.  lol"}, {"topLevelComment": "Wake up sheeple"}, {"topLevelComment": "When did this conspiracy first start, like when did people start hearing about it? the first time i heard about this conspiracy was like back in 2006 about that time frame. the only bits i heard was from the internet and from reading about it."}, {"topLevelComment": "Someone check for crystal meth in this guys house"}, {"topLevelComment": "I bet he's scared of lizards."}, {"topLevelComment": "Dude is a lizard himself...making all that money off of lies.

Activist say the American Indians were killed and had their land stolen from them by the White Europeans and because of that, modern day governments should give the ancestors of these American Indians reparations. But, the American Indians that had the land taken from them by the whites took it from other American Indians by force. The American Indians that had it taken by force from other American Indians took it by force from other A.I.. In some cases, those A.I. that took it by force killed so much of the A.I. tribe that they took the land from, that the tribe ceased to exist. Why should modern governments(money being collected from all its citizens) pay reparations to the last tribe that happened to have the land when the white people took it from them? Other activist say the white man took their land and made them go live on reservations. Well that was much better treatment than what A.I. did to other A.I. when they took their land. All people that conquered other people since the beginning of the world did horrible things to the people they conquered. Why should the citizens of America, which by the way, my people came over from Denmark in 1915, give their taxes to the ancestors of people whose own people did the same exact thing to the people they conquered? All of these conquests were morally wrong and let's all pray that human beings will stop them.

If you read the book again now, you will find its not so interesting,\nand you will wonder why you thought it was good. Its because when you read a book, it is relative\nto what you know and are just now. eg a book may be explaining clever ways to make money on the stock\nexchange. But then you try the ideas out over some months and lose all your money. So in 10 years time\nwhen you start reading the book again, you throw it away because you know its wrong, and \nalso know why its wrong.\n\n\nif you really scrutinise things like the original question, you will get a migraine, because you are trying to use logic,\nbut all logic rests upon axioms, things you take to be true without question,\n\nie logic is always relative, there is no such thing as absolute logic. logic is always only a way of furtherance,\nto further a structure, logic is not about initialising. The initialisation of a logical system begins by looking at\npre-existing examples. \n\nso its all futile, you are trying to establish \"everything\" using \"logic\", but \"logic\" can only establish things relatively,\nso it cant be done. the problem is the word \"why\" in the question \"why does the universe exist?\". \"why\" is to explain one thing in terms of others. But then how to explain those others? To explain them in terms of even more others. Eventually you have to stop.\nSo its like to utilise a dictionary, you need to already know a lot of words. Provided you know some critical mass of words, you can then learn more from a dictionary. Where do the initial words come from? from context, ie from examples of things and someone using the word for the things. \n\nif a question leads to going round and round in circles, like the above video, then you should abandon the question,\nfind questions where you progress. As a general rule you should start with very basic questions,\neg a much more basic question is \"what is the easiest way to make money?\",\n\nthat itself can be preceded by an even more basic question:\n\n\"is there any easy way to make money?\"\n\ngive an example.\n\nI personally think the only easy ways to make money depend on you already having money,\nif you dont have any money then it is very difficult to make money, the poverty trap.\n\nNow you see here, that by asking a basic question I have started to make some progress. That you need money to make money,\nso we can look at another question, how do you make money using money? \n\nIf you start with very basic questions, you can gradually ask more difficult questions, when they are too difficult, then back off\nand try something else.\n\nBut if you go to \"meaning of everything\" questions, you will never progress, all you end up doing is perhaps understanding the question better.\n\nyou shouldnt waste time on such questions, toy around with them for a bit, but eventually get the point that the question is a bad question.\n\nI think his comments on buddhism were a bit underhand, all belief systems are just as nihilistic, eg atheism says there is no higher purpose to things, and christianity says that we are incapable of saving ourselves, that only Jesus can save us. Judaism says that their followers only have worth because they are descended from Abraham, that they arent worthy because of anything they do.\n\nthere is a guy called Ahmed Osman who wrote a book called \"stranger in the valley of the kings\" which says that the jews arent descended from Abraham! That Abraham's wife temporarily was married to a pharaoh according to the bible, and she was pregnant from the pharaoh. That was why Abraham wanted to sacrifice the child. If his theory is right, then it is the arabs who have the covenant from god and are the chosen people! So all the jews and christians are in fact worshipping the arabs!\n\nthe jews are in fact descended from a pharaoh, and that probably is why they outdo everyone because they are descended from atlantean gods!\n\nbuddhism in fact says something quite profound, that salvation is only possible through ethics and not through belief, which is at odds with say christianity which says that salvation is only possible through belief, even though the parable of the good samaritan essentially says ethics is more important than belief, where in the parable the unreligious samaritan is the hero, but the religious guy is the villain.\n\nscience also is overrated, in everyday life we virtually never use any science. eg we drive around in a car and go shopping, but we dont use physics to do that. Basically for day to day living, we only use a tiny tiny amount of science. Biology is the most useful because you can use it to keep healthy. cosmology ie what Hawkings did, is completely worthless for day to day living.\n\nI much prefer that film \"passengers\" which explains via a story some of the futility of space travel and technology."}, {"topLevelComment": "Because we are all God"}, {"topLevelComment": "I just wasted 17:21 minutes of my existence."}, {"topLevelComment": "Should be any reason for the existence of the universe?"}, {"topLevelComment": "All your answers are in the bible"}, {"topLevelComment": "An empty that is nothing is solid."}, {"topLevelComment": "You can see your brain evolving energy under your eyelids black and grey and sometimes color with practice.

And this is where natural forces come in such as gravity. The gravity pulls all the stuff together so that the void or nothing can be smaller as it only exists between stuff. The gravity pulls it all together so that it can be as close to nothing as possible. The cycle of the universe is singularity, big bang, expansion as a result of big bang, gravity slows it down and eventually pulls it back together to singularity then the cycle repeats. Gravity is a result of the nothing wanting to be nothing. But why doesn't the singularity stay a singularity? The laws of nature still apply to keep it together as a singularity and the forces act within it. Imagine being inside a star at the centre and all the matter is around you. You would be pulled in all directions. Where on the outside its pulls inward. These two opposing things create a churning effect within the star creating movement, cause and effect. The whole time its trying to get smaller and denser per metre cubed. But at the same time pushing outward from the centre and eventually it goes blammo big bang. Expands and the nothing of the universe wants to pull it all back together. Im repeating myself as much as the cycle."}, {"topLevelComment": "Adds nothing....."}, {"topLevelComment": "Since many people misunderstand, or copy the misunderstanding about buddhism, when informing themselves about it: The statement \"nothing = the world, the world = nothing\" does not describe the essence or worldview of buddhist thought. \nThere is a term in buddhism, which can be translated into something like \"emptiness\" or \"nothingness\", but this word refers more to the fact, that every obeject (human, a car, an animal, a plant, an atom, anything) is empty of a self. Everything is ever changing, not in any moment the same as before. If you think this through all the way - or better do a few vipassana retreats - you will understand/know that \"emptiness\" (or \"nothingsness\", as Holt refers to here) = everything is everything else, and thus empty of a self.

If he's confined by any of these three, he's not God. God must be outside of our comprehension of our 3 dimensional world. A 3 dimensional being can interact directly with 2D being, but. 2D being can't directly interact with 3D being without 3D being's participation. No one in 3D world can understand what a higher dimension entity is thinking or what it looks like.\nWe can seek to understand everything in our 3D world, but we won't be able to understand someone from a higher dimension. If you and me can fit the concept of God in our 3 pound brain, he's not God and definitely not worth worshipping that's for certain. The question asking where or when did God come from is impossible.\nThe Biblical God like a painter and the universe we live in is like      a canvas. He can create drawings on the canvas as he sees fit. The moment he started drawing would be the creation of time, space, and matter. Clearly he's outside of the canvas, he's not limited by it. He can interact directly with the canvas but the it cannot directly interact with the painter.

Since we cant prove anything, here is a an Actual Christian's opinion: God (who is not part of this realm, who is not in the 3rd or 4th or any dimension, He is outside of space and time) created everything, including the Higgs Boson. We as Christians cant argue where God came from because we BELIEVE, not know, we believe since God (or whatever name you want to call a creator) is outside of pure existence, He is in a realm that we dont understand, time might not even exist so we cant say there was a beginning of creating Him. We believe for whatever reason, he created the higgs which pretty much creates everything else. We dont actually think the earth is 6000 years old. No where in the bible does it say that. We believe we are part of something we dont understand and will never understand. This is why we believe God sent Jesus/Himself to live with us to understand how stupid we all are and to give us hope that the answer to all conflict is love. We have nothing against science, we love science because we believe it is the deep study of Gods creation. But we will always be ridiculed and mocked for a simple belief that actually makes more sense than saying that something (higgs) just popped into existence on its own and created everything.

Hope it helps somebody. \n\nl Neural Networks can recognize hand written digits, letters, words ( in general, tokens )\n l What are Neurons?\n  \u25cb Something that holds a number [ 0, 1]\n  \u25cb The higher the number, the higher the \"activation\" rate\n l Consider a 28*28 table in which each unit is represented by a value between 0 to 1 ( activation number )\n  \u25cb Let us divide each row into a \"layer\", such that, if we were to divide all the layers, the last layer would contain 10 \"cells\" ( units ).\n  \u25cb Values are passed from the previous cells to the last layer ( 10 unit layer ), again, between 0 and 1. The higher or closer the value is to 1, the more probability exists that the image scanned represents that unit cell.\n    So, a unit cell that contains the highest value is indication that the index of the unit cell is the value of the image scanned.\n  \u25cb 16 cells in the second and third last cells are arbitrary.\n  \u25cb Each cell is linked ( causes activation ) to some ( not all ) other cells in the next layer which further cause more activation.\n  \u25cb Each 'cell' corresponds to some sort of identification about how much a certain region 'lights up', and then sends a value to another node which reacts based on the received value. \n  \u25cb To find whether a certain cell with light us, like each cell be represented by 'a Cell_Number ', and let each cell be 'assigned' a certain weight 'w'. The sum of all the products of each cells 'a' and 'w' will be:  \n   w1*a1 + w2*a2 + w3*a3 + w4*a4 + \u2026  + wn*an \n  \u25cb Let these weighted sums represent some 'grid cell'. Each cell is either 'on' or 'off' with respect to being positive or negative. In this case, 'green' represents on, and 'red' represents off.\n  \u25cb Let us concern ourselves to a certain region where the cells are mostly on. Ergo, we would be basically summing up the weightages of those grid cells.\n  \u25cb Then, if you suppose a region where there are brighter grid cells in some part which are surrounded by dark grid cells, then that area is the main edge we're looking for.\n  \u25cb Of course the sum of weightages gives us very different value. In order to 'squish' that number line into 0 and 1 , we use the function:\n   Sigma(x) = 1/(1 + e^-x)\n  Which is a sigmoid function or a Logistic Curve. Our equation now becomes:\n   Sigmoid(w1*a1 + w2*a2 + w3*a3 + w4*a4 + \u2026  + wn*an)\n  \u25cb But what if you don't always want to light up when it's a positive value, and rather want it to light up when the weighted sum of that grid cell full fills some condition, such as > 10. This is called 'Bias For Inactivity'. Using this example, our equation becomes,\n   Sigmoid(w1*a1 + w2*a2 + w3*a3 + w4*a4 + \u2026  + wn*an  - 10)\n   Here, 10 is the \"bias\".\n  \u25cb The possibilities of the different knobs and dials open us to the term of \"Learning\", which just means to find the correct relation of values which perform the expected behavior. \n  \u25cb The complete expression above can be adjusted in the formula:\n   a(1) = Sigma(W*a(0) + b )\n   ( (1) and (0) are superscript here )\n\n   Where W = k*n matrix whose elements are weights corresponding to a cell.\n   a(0) = n*1 matrix whose elements are the 'a' of each cell.\n   b= n*1 matrix whose elements are the biases of each cell \n  \u25cb NOTE: Sigmoid function is not used very often now, instead it is replaced by ReLU ( Rectified Linear Unity ), which is defined as:\nReLU(a) = max(0, a), a linear function where f(a) = a for a>= 0, which for a < 0, f(a) = 0."}, {"topLevelComment": "Anyone else have this this pop up on recommended?", "reply": "yes i do not know why though"}, {"topLevelComment": "\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0443\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e"}, {"topLevelComment": "You sir, have a gift for explaining the complex in a way people with minimal background can understand.

What exactly is the issue here? These seem like decent people... The obvious implication is that we should have freedom of identity, as long as our perceived identity is not a detriment to society or an endangerment to our safety and well being. The argument that these students are making is just that; identifying as a certain gender is a prerogative without any obvious social or legal repercussions. Acceptance and diversity are some of the most basic and fundamental components of humanity and compassion.

Eat my dust, Einstein.\n\nReason: No one takes into account in physics that for all measurement to be made in a theoretically infinite universe, finite relative approximation, i.e. Limited Perception, which is every kind of \"perception\", must occur. When perception occurs, there is distortion of absolute infinite reality, and that is what creates what is uniquely a human reality, which appears fractal in nature and \"governed\" by natural laws. Mathematic and physics for us is like language; it allows us to conceptualize the notion of individual \"bodies\" by drawing boundaries around certain to-scale relative packets of relative information, basically pulling the abstract out of thin air and supposing it to be parceled out just as we imagine it. This is false, because there are no bodies in what is absolute reality. In truth, everything that is measured is measured on a number line with infinity on one side and zero on the other. Neither one can truly exist because neither infinity nor zero may ever truly be realized, although there is an obvious allusion to both in our perception of things. In the reality that is beyond finiteness, which can by its very definition not be \"real\" or \"realized\" by an approximating perceiving body, there is only infinitely increasing and decreasing scales of relative information and intersections of the interactions of that information which are pertinent to our existences as the relative creatures we are. Anything beyond our scale of \"usefulness\" by function of its lack of relativity in scale ceases to be. That is why understanding the incredibly small and understanding the incredibly large is about as limited as actually attaining \"absolute zero\" or calculating pi to its final decimal value. The feats are impossible to achieve, not because we do not understand something about theoretical physics or the universe, but because we refuse to acknowledge that there are breaks in the laws of what we are capable of, as finite relative approximating creatures. \n\nThe answer to Einsteins issue about whether the moon was there or not when he turned his back, and particle-wave duality is not a question of physics; it's a question of whether or not we can accept that only does the infinite body become realized, in other words, conceptualized as or made finite, when it is relatively and therefor finitely approximated in its value by the perceiving body and thus pulled out of nowhere, into a world of abstraction. The duality of particles depends on whether or not we approximate them, because in truth they are infinite. Infinite bodies cannot exist however, by definition, because a boundary must be drawn, and so it becomes rather, a question of perception and skew and nothing else.\n\n- Forrest Reed"}, {"topLevelComment": "Impressive!"}, {"topLevelComment": "What means E,m,csquare in formula pls reply"}, {"topLevelComment": "Why do Americans say Einstein's name correctly, but mispronounce other Jewish family names?"}, {"topLevelComment": "Look at a diagram pic of E=Mc2.

Only waves exist. What we think of as particles are interactions between these waves, including Einstein's experiment. In Einstein's experiment the photon wave has, depending on various details, some probability of interacting with the electron wave, and when it happens, the electron wave changes its path and electron gets ejected. In the double slit experiment the single photon wave passes through both slits, the passage affecting the details of its probability of interacting with other waves. The single photon wave hits the screen at a single or rather confined location because when it interacts with the electron waves in the screen, it has to do so at the location of a single electron wave (I have to reconfirm my memory that a  single photon can only interact with a single particle at a time), the wave does not collapse into a particle, but interacts with a single other wave and we observe this interaction AT THE LOCATION of the electron (i.e. it is localization but not really a wave collapse or change from wave to particle).

We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, that accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everbody's nobody.\u201d - Rust Cohle", "reply": "Because we are Earth bound, we only think of our experiences according to our human senses, including what we perceive to be gravity and our sense of time.  NASA creates experiments in space that opens avenues..  The next step is to utilise  artificial intelligence with quantum computing to go beyond our human consciousness.. The vacuum created using the 2 slit experiment can be a very useful experiment to come to faster and more accurate truths.

You can take several salad dressings and you can have the one that fits your mood or fits best with the different components that you can make various types of salad from.  He speaks as if his take on this \"choice\" matter is universal, but it's not.  Furthermore, his arguments, based on logical fallacies, have a definite purpose, as most fallacious arguments do.  He is pushing an argument in favor of global income redistribution, to \"help\" us with our \"too many choices\" and provide those choices to the rest of the planet.  However, it doesn't require us to give up our choices for the rest of the world to have more choices.  What, we should ship half of our salad dressing choices to the third world?\n\nAlso, historically, the redistribution of wealth doesn't affect the most affluent people on the planet, the so-called 1%.  Instead, it involves middle-class people giving up what they have to help those in less-developed areas of the world.  The real wealth redistribution that would make sense globally would be to take the wealth of the elites, those in the wealthiest 10% of the population who own over 90% of the world's wealth and resources, and redistribute that to the rest of us.  But that is never on the table."}, {"topLevelComment": "This dovetails nicely with things I've learned from the minimalism movement.

There already exists A.I. with legal rights, IRS  accepted religion, and it's own currency. Could there be similar options for \"trans-humans\" when they exist as commonly as microwave ovens do today? How far does it go before we're basically a linked hive mind consciousness connected through \"the cloud\" or whatever comes after? What would happen the day everyone had direct access to all the worlds information at the drop of a thought and had to make decisions as a group?

Steve itself mentioned this in an interview.. The early precursor of these companies are innovative and filled with people passionately believing in the innovation they are bringing, They work hard and take risks to make a leap of faith. Lo and behold they introduce something brilliant and grows tremendously. The golden ideas they build their success on becomes the mainstream and the companies slowly push the innovation driven risk takers out of the board room into back offices and research jobs. The marketing and the sales types get promoted as they are considered to be the ones bringing in the customers and the money. The marketing guys at best understands what goes inside of their products in a trivial fashion or they understand only sales numbers and customer feedback. They simply cant connect the dots well.\nThey don't understand that the DNA of a great product is forward thinking before the market and having vision and commitment to make that into a reality. A path breaking product cannot be build just on customer feedback alone because most customers know only the current possibility. The marketing leaders in the board room also don't get it. The Xerox case or the Kodak case exactly demonstrates it. \nThe R&D types who are never in the board rooms are rarely is listened to. Steve's brilliance is understanding how a customer would understand the value of a technology. One of his critical abilities was to translate and package technology in the way a consumer will want to experience it. In short Product vision. To be a product leader you should be both a technocrat as well as a first class business executive.\nEven Steve didn't really succeed with the Mac. It was not a run away financial success as Steve expected.  Apple made more money from Lisa than the Mac. He was pushed out of the company by Scully over differences on strategy. He then went on to make Next computer, a high end computer for education sector. Steve went back to perfecting technology, understand emerging technologies and learning the ropes of market innovation in Next. One thing he always did was to surrounding him with the best engineering and design people. He was willing to pay premium for that.\nMost people don't how advanced Next OS was in 1992-93. It had all features like seamless mail integration and clickable context based content processing with rich media, seamless content type detection and data sharing between applications. etc. The OS was entirely written using OOP(Object oriented programming) paradigm(Except for the core kernel I believe).\nApple was slowly losing market share through the early 90's since Scully based it on the DTP  use-cases that Steve had identified for it and then they stopped innovating. Some of the disgruntled team in Apple left and created BeOS and the  BeBox. I had worked with this OS too. Very advanced for its time. Steve was reinventing himself and his strategic vision.  Luckily for him, Apple was in dire straits by 95-96. They had terrible failure in bringing a true Mult-tasking operating system with advancements in memory management. Meanwhile Next and BeOS were by the time doing true pre-emptive multitasking which optimizes the way application uses memory and cpu resources. Meaning faster and responsive system on relatively cheaper hardware that allowed users to quickly switch between Back ground and foreground tasks.\nApple bought NExt for the technology and Steve insisted on his old position in the company. He ruthlessly threw people who opposed him out of the firm. He was battle hardened and experienced by now. Steve created his own team of brilliant engineers. The first product that came out was the iMAC, those beautiful well engineered machines with translucent cases with monitors and the computer in one enclosure. That was Steves move to get his customers excited in Apple again, with a computer of great aesthetic and user experience value. Apple was back in the innovation business.

Not because they had to, but because they were hungry for knowledge and wanted to learn. Even today you walk into any university or industry and you will find that there are but a handful of people who actually love what they do or know what they are doing. Without them these institutions or companies will fade away or collapse in time.  However, today more than ever in human history, children are sent to school. Many of them from families with little or no education. These parents have never experienced higher levels of thinking. In fact this is a territory in their view where pain resides.  Intelligence is associated with dishonesty and corruption. So they plant this seed into their children\u2019s minds at an early age. It is also likely that learning is not high on their priority list. So, they enter the education system and the world expects miracles. And miracles do happen but not of the same magnitude or rate  that people expect. Now I am not saying that the education system is perfect by any means. But neither are our expectations. For the masses, enslaved by ignorance, out dated beliefs and ideas  we need to adjust our expectations. The idea of revolution in the education system is nonsense. I dislike revolutions as they are very disruptive, costly, unpredictable and cannot be managed. It makes a good show and makes a possibly a few bucks, but it is irresponsible and naive. Education system has been changing, but the task ahead is of such magnitude that it will take time, possibly a few generations to see the outcome. We must not forget that at no time during human history the rate at which scientific and technological discoveries occur has been of such speed and magnitude. To blame the education system when people are still struggling with nationalism, xenophobia, tribal mentality, bigotry and a multitude of other social problems is simply unfair and undermines the good work of many who have dedicated their life to it."}, {"topLevelComment": "I'm in high school in India and I do get it why so many children in contemporary countries my age are dropping out.

Being an empath, the slave-like treatment of both students and teachers affects me. oh yes, it does. I have a knack for learning and working hard and teaching and learning some more but it just feels the education systems are a dead end and it's time, actually it's been time since decades that the mainstream education system reinvents itself. Children after children are suffering from anxiety. Obviously, something wrong is happening on a big scale. I have never enjoyed science like this before.

Love & Peace to All"}, {"topLevelComment": "i like this guy"}, {"topLevelComment": "At the core of every \u201eproblem\u201d is: what is what we want. That is driven by values. What do WE consider as valuable and what not? Kids have an extreme tendency to exactly follow the values and ideas communicated to them by their parents. As parents you have to be really carful if your own attitude encourages or discourages learning. The U.S., but also many other societies are driven by stereotypes and ideologies:\u00a0 EVERY German is punctual. EVERY Asian is smart. Most of the them are plain wrong. But media keeps repeating them, as people LOVE hearing ideology that has been taught to them. If give this warm feeling of false confidence.\nThere are a couple of stereotypes and values typical for the U.S., that harm education in certain social groups.\n1.)\u00a0\u201cYou have to work hard to make it\u201d. Mostly wrong. In an industrialized society you have to work smart to make it. The hard work is done by the cheapest people that only have one skill to offer: muscle power. Those are the worst paid jobs. In the US usually done by immigrants.\n2.)\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t depend on others. A real man makes it on his one.\u201d Mostly wrong. That might have been true for a short period during the colonization, where there was nobody else available. But in todays world cooperation and collaboration are essential factors to success.\n3.)\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t waist your time learning. You can learn it on the job. Go make money\u201d. No. You can\u2019t. Todays works has gotten so complex and complicated, that without proper training you are not being accepted for higher paid jobs at all. You need to continue to learn while on the job. But without the proper foundation only very few will make it.\n4.)\u00a0\u201cThey will anyways not accept you \u2013 don\u2019t even try\u201d. If you are black you just can\u2019t make it. Wrong. You can be the US president. But if you never start learning you will never get anywhere\nThese stereotypes typically infect the minds of lower class and lower middle-class people, who usually have a low education level themselves. And they pass them on to their children. \nIt is a measured fact that the success of children in the education system strongly depends on the attitude of their parents to the value of education. E.g. in Finland you have to work smart. You can\u2019t just go out and be a farmer. The weather conditions in Finland are way to harsh. In Finland you can only survive if you use advanced technologies. You MUST learn. The more advanced the better. The same applies to Japan. 80% of Japan are too step for farming. In these countries\u2019 education is one the highest values. IN many parts of the U.S. it is not.\nThe talk isn\u2019t all wrong.

The course is about the interconnection between physiology and behaviour and the way that the psychological, neurological and biological elements impact each other to create the wildly unpredictable thing known as human behaviour. Because of the complexity of human behavior, we think about things in categories, which makes them easier to understand. But, there are problems with categorical thinking. They can limit, distort and misrepresent thinking. You have trouble seeing differences among items that are in the same category, you overestimate how different they are when there's a boundary between them, and when you're focused on the categorical boundaries, you don't see the big picture."}, {"topLevelComment": "Put my business hw away and got distracted by this.

Some animals intermixed in their grazing, but most grazed the plains in succession.  Massive herds of gigantic bison ate the bounty of the grasslands at a slightly different time than the different huge deer and elk species and other mammals.  One type of mammal might eat the emerging shoots as they migrated through an area, followed later by another groups of mammals eating more mature grass, followed by others eating tall standing grass, and others preferring the dried grasses, etc.  Mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses liked colder areas closer to the glaciers.  Smaller deer (without the massive antlers of their larger cousins) grazed in the forests.  But all these animals migrated seasonally through the feeding areas, eating the available food at different times, rarely competing for the exact same resource.  As they moved through, they trampled the grasses and left their dung and urine (and sometimes their bones when they fell to four-legged predators or human hunters) to nourish the soil as Allan Savory described.  The grasslands renewed themselves every year until the retreat of the glaciers changed the climate.  \n\nAs others have mentioned, America was much like this when we had single bison herds numbering in the millions migrating across the western plains.  But those grasslands were also shared by other large herds of  mammal species also migrating through at different times as well.  Therefore, it seems to me that if we could restore herds of mixed species to some of our desertified lands, we might achieve what Allan Savory has done in his projects.  I hope he is consulting with the American government and park service to do just that!  But we'd also have to restore their natural predators to keep the herds in check (Savory mentioned the lions in the African projects.)"}, {"topLevelComment": "Peter Andrews has been doing this for 35 years in Australia - He calls it Holistic Land Management - Returning it back to how it was before farming led to soil erosion and salt build up.

The role of grazing or the movement of the herds to maintain the fertility of the savannas and regenerate the grass.\nBut do not confuse things. 1He of grass absorbs the same amount of CO2 as 1 tree in the Amazon jungle. You have to take into account the surface of the leaves.\nThat the herds are displaced is great, but at present the meat industry has 1,700 million cows and I do not think it would be profitable to take them out for a walk.\nThe suggestion that we are going to avoid climate change with cattle and eat more meat is playing with our intelligence.\nFor a pasture to become a forest it takes a few million years."}, {"topLevelComment": "Absolutely Brilliant!!!

Extremely complicated to introduce as it is not only about trampling by moving livestock, it also includes \"planning for natural regeneration\" and as such avoid overgrazing. In case of common grazing areas, all animals have to join the herd. If few animals do not join but allowed to graze uncontrolled, these few animals WILL overgraze (and kill) the most edible grass species and at the same time grow better then their 'colleagues' in the herd... \nSo all farmers with grazing animals have to be convinced for their animals to join the herd. The herd must move according to a certain plan in order to increase natural regeneration. \nSo if land is owned and used by one or few farmers (or government), then quite easy to introduce.

Not to mention, this idea that sandberg speaks of is very similar to trickle down economics in that if we have more women at the top, their success will reach the women at the bottom, making less than a dollar a day.

Thank you for taking the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with two of them).\n\nDoes hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden variables must update faster than light - they would be considered 'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be conserved in the universe.\n\nEveryone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability of up/down.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Stephen Bartlett, University of Sydney: http://bit.ly/1xSosoJ\nProf. John Preskill, Caltech: http://bit.ly/1y8mJut\n\nLooking Glass Universe: http://bit.ly/17zZH7l\nPhysics Girl: http://bit.ly/PhysGirl\nMinutePhysics: http://bit.ly/MinPhys\nCommunity Channel: http://bit.ly/CommChannel\nNigel, Helen, Luke, and Simon for comments on earlier drafts of this video.\n\nFilmed in part by Scott Lewis: http://google.com/+scottlewis\n\nMusic by Amarante \"One Last Time\": http://bit.ly/VeAmarante", "viewCount": "2338777", "likeCount": "45311", "dislikeCount": "1047", "commentCount": "6727", "comments": [{"topLevelComment": "Spooky, but informationless, action at a distance"}, {"topLevelComment": "What is the mechanism that allows us to measure the spin property of a particle?"}, {"topLevelComment": "M confused , how Albert Einstein involved in quantum mechanism because he was a thetorical Physicist of cosmology ??"}, {"topLevelComment": "wait...

But with this explanation you could easily produce FTL communication right? by measuring multiple particles at an angle at one point then measuring them arbitrarily at another point at another place, you get the frequency at which angles they occur, you can use this frequency of occurrence as a communication method right? \n\nTo further explain, at 7:20 you mention how the angle makes 60 degrees in the other measure things. Thats because the first particle measured was measured in the first one right. And because of this the occurrence is 2/3. By measuring say 100 particles you can get the frequency in which it will be spin up or down. That information isn't useless and can be used as a communication method. P.S.

Spooky action at a distance is not spooky at all.

There is no such thing as photon particle/light quanta. Photoelectric effect theory won a Nobel Prize, but later Einstein admitted it was wrong.\n\nAll these fifty years of conscious brooding have brought me no nearer to the answer to the question, 'What are light quanta?' Nowadays every Tom, D i c k and Harry thinks he knows it, but he is mistaken. -Albert Einstein 1954\n\nLine of sight charged particles are connected by electrostatic force F=Ke x pq/rr, that force is constantly at work. Therefore line of sight charged particles are electrically entangled.\n\nThe repulsion force between 2 electrons at distance r is F=Ke x ee/rr. That force act as a mass less stiff rod, connected the 2 electrons as 1. Electrostatic force rules the universe. It responsible for quantum entanglement, light, energy, induction, gravity and magnetism, all nature phenomena.\n\nAll maters are connected in space by two forces. Gravity and electron's repulsion force.

The survivors of this cataclysm eventually became the Egyptians, who carried on the ancient knowledge of the previous civilization. All confirmed Egyptian tombs are thoroughly decorated with heiroglyphics yet not a single pyramid found in Egypt contains even a single heiroglyphics, nor has a mummy ever been found in a pyramid. On top of that, there is no known heiroglyph that says or shows anything about the pyramids or their building. There is no actual evidence that the Egyptians built the pyramids, other than the location and the knowledge of the civilzation.\n\nBecause of this information and the nearly definitive evidence that there was a massive cataclysm caused by an impact 13,000 years ago (which also ties in really well the the great flood, which is scientifically proven to have happened through geological evidence of massive changes in sea level and deposits of marine life in areas far above sea level), I believe it is possible that an advanced civilization existed before the Egyptians (before Sumerians as well) and is responsible for building the Great Pyramid.

Because they profit from the charities that spring up in the face of inequity and repression. They need more disenfranchised poor and downtrodden, more grist for the mill, or they don't get into heaven, and the other side wins... In Australia more and more social services, paid for by taxpayers!, are being subsumed into the hands of the cronies of the religious right in politics, so they can profit from the public purse and push a particular religious ideology, to keep it current and relevant in an increasingly secular society.

Policies have been put into place that make Australia a place hostile to doing business in the traditional sense.

Mr Krugman pontificates as if no one with a lower income is aware of what wealth is or how it's managed.\n\nHe has foolishly trotted out that canard about health insurance and how the HCRA benefitted people. Firstly, he demonstrates his own naive understanding of what health care is like in the USA for people of low to moderate income.\n\n There are 3 basic ways low income people receive health care, and it hasn't changed by any significance since the passage of the HCRA. \n1- Show up as an emergency indigent person in need.\n2- Medicare recipient.\n3- Health insurance through employment. This is where most people who have insurance obtain it. The worse part is, premiums have escalated significantly as well as deductibles, and co-pays. \nA small fraction of the population, who were unable to afford health insurance, still can't because even the government site is ridiculous. It's like paying COBRA rates. The burden for states, already having financial difficulties, increased substantially when their Medicare coverage costs escalated to cover the totally uninsured who applied for subsidies. So where or in what tangible (not theoretical) way have we benefitted through the passage of the HCRA?\n\nThere's this imagined bogeyman called \"the wealthy\", which as the story goes in Capitalism 101, we're to aspire, but once you have wealth, you're selfish, greedy, and undeserving. How's that work for you?\n\nIf that's your target to save the country, you've done a ready fire aim approach. \n\nIf you want to use statistics then what are the wealthy paying in real-time tax dollars after credits, deductions, etc? I'm not talking about the legal entities, corporations, but the people who work and or own major shares. \n\nThose 10% wealthy, Krugman refers to pay over 70% of the taxes. Furthermore, even during times of higher or more progressive tax rates, the money collected for the treasury has remained around 17.5% effective. \n\nWhat isn't being addressed, and continues to be our American challenge is the vast difference we collect in taxes vs. what we as a nation spend.\n\nI've been a working person since I was 15 and never obtained much wealth, but I can still say, I've lived well and I haven't lost any sleep over what the wealthy receive in compensation or gave accumulated. If Mr. Krugman is feeling burdened or guilty from his aggregate economic benefits, I will gladly swap saving, investments, and bank accounts with him.\n\nThe America I live in, for almost 7 decades, is a far more kind and generous country than what Mr. Krugman claims. His description of \"an ugly America\" is far from what I've seen. And yes, I've seen most of it. These alarmist claims, based on incorrect assumptions and data defy what people who have worked most of their lives to achieve. Unlike the summary given by Bill Moyers, I don't envy nor am I jealous of the Bezos, Buffets, Gates, Soros, Koch brothers, or the Walton family. Should they be forced by law to pay those who work for them more money, or pay higher taxes? I guess that's still open for debate, but in so far as I have learned, if you personally produce or possess something of great value, then you're very likely to be compensated according to that value."}, {"topLevelComment": "The 1% works hard instead of bitching about it on youtube.

Traditional thinking is you need to quit cold-turkey and live with cravings one-day-at-a-time and go to meetings for the rest of your life. Many people relapse with these traditional methods. Relapse is rare with TSM - which is proven very effective in over 70 clinical studies."}, {"topLevelComment": "Alcohol is a poison."}, {"topLevelComment": "Congratulations Aela!"}, {"topLevelComment": "Alcohol is bae"}, {"topLevelComment": "My husband drinks a lot. It makes me tired. He constantly looks me in the eye and promises he'll stop for sure \"this time\" but lies and goes behind my back. He thinks I don't know and notice this but I do. He blames his stress of work and stuff on it. But even in our best moments he goes back to drinking. How can I help him? Some recommendations? Or should I leave my husband because he won\u2019t stop smoking? Any help would be highly appreciated."}, {"topLevelComment": "After 10 years of dealing with this addiction ive made drastic changes.

I myself had become a chronic drinker largely due to living on one of the Top 5 Most Alcoholic Cities in America, though bordedom, loneliness and/or frustration were exacerbating factors. Basically: going along to get along. I eventually quit, with no AA, no counseling, no chemical treatment \u2013 just comprehensive disgust with alcohol, its effect upon my life, and its prevalence in the world around me. For the first few months (after getting down to regular-but-moderate amounts), I fell into a deep depression, which apparently occurs because the brain grows accustomed to alcohol's presence for the endophin action. After riding that out, I felt great, getting re-acquainted with my true self, and have no compulsion ever to drink acohol."}]}]]]
