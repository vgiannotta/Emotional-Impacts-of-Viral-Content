    "# Data Collection Part II: YouTube Videos\n",
    "\n",
    "The measure of video popularity on YouTube based on the number of views the video receives. This statement is somewhat subjective, as there is again in this case no formal definition of what constitutes a \"viral\" video. However, we can infer from the placement of the \"views\" widget on the YouTube plaform, and it's relative prominance compared to the \"likes,\" that this is the best metric for measuring popularity of a video. For this reason, I chose to use views as my main search criteria, though I did collect likeCount and dislikeCount for each video object as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube's video search functionaity is somewhat less robust than that of Reddit. Google allows developers to enter a search query in their API call, however the search term can only be a single string and will only search based on video title. In order to execute a search for videos with the all-time highest views, I wrote a search query that would search every combination of letters and numbers, and then filtered that result by view count. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Collection Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Again here, the video comments were stored separately from the main video data, as were the video stats. In fact, the initial API call only returned video metadata and video ids for the specified tearch terms. I chained two additional API calls onto the original one and set the output as a series of nested dictionaries. Comment replies were, in this case, a bit easier to control, in that I was able to set a maximum limit. The data returned have up to 50 comments per video, and up to 20 replies per comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the limit of 50 results per top-level API call, I ran the call function many times and simply worte a series of JSON files to the local directory, and joined them together in a later notebook."

If you do you might know that not all patients get the same medication dose or the same number of medications. Some patients of high blood pressure can get better by just lifestyle changes (like exercise, losing weight) or very minor medications. Some of the patients need two three or ever five or six medications. \\r\\nJust like blood pressure diabetes cannot be boxed into one small box. Wish I had time to explain this in detail. \\r\\nA crazy statement, diabetes is not a condition of high sugar intake but lack of, ineffective or resistance to INSULIN. Someone can have a complete absence of insulin (as in type 1 diabetes) but others have varying degrees of deficiency or resistance of insulin. Thus trying to tell a type one diabetic to take keto LCHF diet and his diabetes will be criminal if a doctor said it. I will personally take them to court as it will cause the death of the person. \\r\\n\\r\\nA person with mild resistance or deficiency of insulin may get better by the diet (partly by losing weight) but you can prescribe the same treatment for the higher grades of the disease. \\r\\n\\r\\nActually, if a person stops medications or insulin (if they really need it) will result in a condition called ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma and result in patient death. And you will ask how do I know because I as a physician have seen many such deaths over the last 25 years of my carrier.'},\n",

And I am still not sure if it's for me.\\n\\nNow I'd like to share my experience now that you know I am not inclined to believe anything easily.I live next to a practicing witch she's does work for people has attacked me for 30 years.But I'm still here.One day I was watching a T.V. show about a white woman with green eyes pale skin who got involved with the mafia.I noticed she looked a lot like me.She got killed by these mafia people, they found her cut in half in a field not one drop of blood.I sensed immediately and this doesn't happen to me everyday, a finger like touch on my right side of my body and it passed itself all past my stomach to the left side.Like a spirit touching me.I knew it was some warning that what happened to her could happen to me.I knew if there was a possibility it was because of my neighbor's constant witchcraft.(I have been forced to accept the reality of dark magic).\\n\\n Anyway right after all that honest to God the screen changed the documentary was gone and an interference came in but I changed channels to see if the T.V. jumped from one channel to another but no, so I returned to the channel. Suddenly I saw on the screen a lizard like face I will never forget it, I was very focused on the right side of the screen where I meet with an eye it was lightest green and I said to myself this is not a movie but I had a strange calm, the eye was staring at me and I could tell quickly this was a person with very high intelligence.The look was just like looking into the eyes of a genius I could tell this person knew me had a deep penetrating stare.I don't know why I wasn't scared I had already noticed the eye looked human but the skin reptilian the color green was light too and in the creases there were very fine red veins running all over the face.All this took some long seconds but I want to break it down slowly as I lived it. I decided to find the other eye assuming that it was a human like lizard with a face similar to a man's, but as I went on searching for the eye on other side I came across the spot where another eye should have been, there was nothing! This is when I started to get nervous so I kept looking went further, this was a big screen T.V.  not the biggest but large, finally I got to the the other eye and realized it was more like a dragon!!! I was just about to let out the loudest scream when immediately the dragon disappeared and regular programming resumed.\\n\\nI stayed in shock I didn't tell my mother in the next room.I put it out of my mind for a few years.Then I recalled it from time to time in disbelief I finally accepted that when I use to laugh at the retards who talked about reptilians they were not are not sick or foolish people after all. I don't care what anyone yells at me I know what I saw. IT'S REAL. I think these reptilian are of the devil, evil spiritual beings that live in a dimension we can't see they influence us for evil.God in His infinite mercy allowed me to see for myself who that witch works with and their intention.You know what they say knowing is winning half the battle.That's my reality and I'm sticking to it.Thanks for reading.\"},\n",

Activist say the American Indians were killed and had their land stolen from them by the White Europeans and because of that, modern day governments should give the ancestors of these American Indians reparations. But, the American Indians that had the land taken from them by the whites took it from other American Indians by force. The American Indians that had it taken by force from other American Indians took it by force from other A.I.. In some cases, those A.I. that took it by force killed so much of the A.I. tribe that they took the land from, that the tribe ceased to exist. Why should modern governments(money being collected from all its citizens) pay reparations to the last tribe that happened to have the land when the white people took it from them? Other activist say the white man took their land and made them go live on reservations. Well that was much better treatment than what A.I. did to other A.I. when they took their land. All people that conquered other people since the beginning of the world did horrible things to the people they conquered. Why should the citizens of America, which by the way, my people came over from Denmark in 1915, give their taxes to the ancestors of people whose own people did the same exact thing to the people they conquered? All of these conquests were morally wrong and let's all pray that human beings will stop them. But to be selective and ask only certain ancestors to pay other ancestors is unfair.\"},\n",

If you read the book again now, you will find its not so interesting,\\nand you will wonder why you thought it was good. Its because when you read a book, it is relative\\nto what you know and are just now. eg a book may be explaining clever ways to make money on the stock\\nexchange. But then you try the ideas out over some months and lose all your money. So in 10 years time\\nwhen you start reading the book again, you throw it away because you know its wrong, and \\nalso know why its wrong.\\n\\n\\nif you really scrutinise things like the original question, you will get a migraine, because you are trying to use logic,\\nbut all logic rests upon axioms, things you take to be true without question,\\n\\nie logic is always relative, there is no such thing as absolute logic. logic is always only a way of furtherance,\\nto further a structure, logic is not about initialising. The initialisation of a logical system begins by looking at\\npre-existing examples. \\n\\nso its all futile, you are trying to establish \"everything\" using \"logic\", but \"logic\" can only establish things relatively,\\nso it cant be done. the problem is the word \"why\" in the question \"why does the universe exist?\". \"why\" is to explain one thing in terms of others. But then how to explain those others? To explain them in terms of even more others. Eventually you have to stop.\\nSo its like to utilise a dictionary, you need to already know a lot of words. Provided you know some critical mass of words, you can then learn more from a dictionary. Where do the initial words come from? from context, ie from examples of things and someone using the word for the things. \\n\\nif a question leads to going round and round in circles, like the above video, then you should abandon the question,\\nfind questions where you progress. As a general rule you should start with very basic questions,\\neg a much more basic question is \"what is the easiest way to make money?\",\\n\\nthat itself can be preceded by an even more basic question:\\n\\n\"is there any easy way to make money?\"\\n\\ngive an example.\\n\\nI personally think the only easy ways to make money depend on you already having money,\\nif you dont have any money then it is very difficult to make money, the poverty trap.\\n\\nNow you see here, that by asking a basic question I have started to make some progress. That you need money to make money,\\nso we can look at another question, how do you make money using money? \\n\\nIf you start with very basic questions, you can gradually ask more difficult questions, when they are too difficult, then back off\\nand try something else.\\n\\nBut if you go to \"meaning of everything\" questions, you will never progress, all you end up doing is perhaps understanding the question better.\\n\\nyou shouldnt waste time on such questions, toy around with them for a bit, but eventually get the point that the question is a bad question.\\n\\nI think his comments on buddhism were a bit underhand, all belief systems are just as nihilistic, eg atheism says there is no higher purpose to things, and christianity says that we are incapable of saving ourselves, that only Jesus can save us. Judaism says that their followers only have worth because they are descended from Abraham, that they arent worthy because of anything they do.\\n\\nthere is a guy called Ahmed Osman who wrote a book called \"stranger in the valley of the kings\" which says that the jews arent descended from Abraham! That Abraham\\'s wife temporarily was married to a pharaoh according to the bible, and she was pregnant from the pharaoh. That was why Abraham wanted to sacrifice the child. If his theory is right, then it is the arabs who have the covenant from god and are the chosen people! So all the jews and christians are in fact worshipping the arabs!\\n\\nthe jews are in fact descended from a pharaoh, and that probably is why they outdo everyone because they are descended from atlantean gods!\\n\\nbuddhism in fact says something quite profound, that salvation is only possible through ethics and not through belief, which is at odds with say christianity which says that salvation is only possible through belief, even though the parable of the good samaritan essentially says ethics is more important than belief, where in the parable the unreligious samaritan is the hero, but the religious guy is the villain.\\n\\nscience also is overrated, in everyday life we virtually never use any science. eg we drive around in a car and go shopping, but we dont use physics to do that. Basically for day to day living, we only use a tiny tiny amount of science. Biology is the most useful because you can use it to keep healthy. cosmology ie what Hawkings did, is completely worthless for day to day living.\\n\\nI much prefer that film \"passengers\" which explains via a story some of the futility of space travel and technology.'},\n",

The gravity pulls it all together so that it can be as close to nothing as possible. The cycle of the universe is singularity, big bang, expansion as a result of big bang, gravity slows it down and eventually pulls it back together to singularity then the cycle repeats. Gravity is a result of the nothing wanting to be nothing. But why doesn't the singularity stay a singularity? The laws of nature still apply to keep it together as a singularity and the forces act within it. Imagine being inside a star at the centre and all the matter is around you. You would be pulled in all directions. Where on the outside its pulls inward. These two opposing things create a churning effect within the star creating movement, cause and effect. The whole time its trying to get smaller and denser per metre cubed. But at the same time pushing outward from the centre and eventually it goes blammo big bang.

We as Christians cant argue where God came from because we BELIEVE, not know, we believe since God (or whatever name you want to call a creator) is outside of pure existence, He is in a realm that we dont understand, time might not even exist so we cant say there was a beginning of creating Him. We believe for whatever reason, he created the higgs which pretty much creates everything else. We dont actually think the earth is 6000 years old. No where in the bible does it say that. We believe we are part of something we dont understand and will never understand.

Hope it helps somebody. \\n\\nl Neural Networks can recognize hand written digits, letters, words ( in general, tokens )\\n l What are Neurons?\\n  ○ Something that holds a number [ 0, 1]\\n  ○ The higher the number, the higher the \"activation\" rate\\n l Consider a 28*28 table in which each unit is represented by a value between 0 to 1 ( activation number )\\n  ○ Let us divide each row into a \"layer\", such that, if we were to divide all the layers, the last layer would contain 10 \"cells\" ( units ).\\n  ○ Values are passed from the previous cells to the last layer ( 10 unit layer ), again, between 0 and 1. The higher or closer the value is to 1, the more probability exists that the image scanned represents that unit cell.\\n    So, a unit cell that contains the highest value is indication that the index of the unit cell is the value of the image scanned.\\n  ○ 16 cells in the second and third last cells are arbitrary.\\n  ○ Each cell is linked ( causes activation ) to some ( not all ) other cells in the next layer which further cause more activation.\\n  ○ Each \\'cell\\' corresponds to some sort of identification about how much a certain region \\'lights up\\', and then sends a value to another node which reacts based on the received value. \\n  ○ To find whether a certain cell with light us, like each cell be represented by \\'a Cell_Number \\', and let each cell be \\'assigned\\' a certain weight \\'w\\'. The sum of all the products of each cells \\'a\\' and \\'w\\' will be:  \\n   w1*a1 + w2*a2 + w3*a3 + w4*a4 + …  + wn*an \\n  ○ Let these weighted sums represent some \\'grid cell\\'. Each cell is either \\'on\\' or \\'off\\' with respect to being positive or negative. In this case, \\'green\\' represents on, and \\'red\\' represents off.\\n  ○ Let us concern ourselves to a certain region where the cells are mostly on. Ergo, we would be basically summing up the weightages of those grid cells.\\n  ○ Then, if you suppose a region where there are brighter grid cells in some part which are surrounded by dark grid cells, then that area is the main edge we\\'re looking for.\\n  ○ Of course the sum of weightages gives us very different value. In order to \\'squish\\' that number line into 0 and 1 , we use the function:\\n   Sigma(x) = 1/(1 + e^-x)\\n  Which is a sigmoid function or a Logistic Curve. Our equation now becomes:\\n   Sigmoid(w1*a1 + w2*a2 + w3*a3 + w4*a4 + …  + wn*an)\\n  ○ But what if you don\\'t always want to light up when it\\'s a positive value, and rather want it to light up when the weighted sum of that grid cell full fills some condition, such as > 10. This is called \\'Bias For Inactivity\\'. Using this example, our equation becomes,\\n   Sigmoid(w1*a1 + w2*a2 + w3*a3 + w4*a4 + …  + wn*an  - 10)\\n   Here, 10 is the \"bias\".\\n  ○ The possibilities of the different knobs and dials open us to the term of \"Learning\", which just means to find the correct relation of values which perform the expected behavior. \\n  ○ The complete expression above can be adjusted in the formula:\\n   a(1) = Sigma(W*a(0) + b )\\n   ( (1) and (0) are superscript here )\\n\\n   Where W = k*n matrix whose elements are weights corresponding to a cell.\\n   a(0) = n*1 matrix whose elements are the \\'a\\' of each cell.\\n   b= n*1 matrix whose elements are the biases of each cell \\n  ○ NOTE: Sigmoid function is not used very often now, instead it is replaced by ReLU ( Rectified Linear Unity ), which is defined as:\\nReLU(a) = max(0, a), a linear function where f(a) = a for a>= 0, which for a < 0, f(a) = 0.'},\n",

The obvious implication is that we should have freedom of identity, as long as our perceived identity is not a detriment to society or an endangerment to our safety and well being.

Acceptance and diversity are some of the most basic and fundamental components of humanity and compassion.

Eat my dust, Einstein.\\n\\nReason: No one takes into account in physics that for all measurement to be made in a theoretically infinite universe, finite relative approximation, i.e. Limited Perception, which is every kind of \"perception\", must occur. When perception occurs, there is distortion of absolute infinite reality, and that is what creates what is uniquely a human reality, which appears fractal in nature and \"governed\" by natural laws. Mathematic and physics for us is like language; it allows us to conceptualize the notion of individual \"bodies\" by drawing boundaries around certain to-scale relative packets of relative information, basically pulling the abstract out of thin air and supposing it to be parceled out just as we imagine it. This is false, because there are no bodies in what is absolute reality. In truth, everything that is measured is measured on a number line with infinity on one side and zero on the other. Neither one can truly exist because neither infinity nor zero may ever truly be realized, although there is an obvious allusion to both in our perception of things. In the reality that is beyond finiteness, which can by its very definition not be \"real\" or \"realized\" by an approximating perceiving body, there is only infinitely increasing and decreasing scales of relative information and intersections of the interactions of that information which are pertinent to our existences as the relative creatures we are. Anything beyond our scale of \"usefulness\" by function of its lack of relativity in scale ceases to be. That is why understanding the incredibly small and understanding the incredibly large is about as limited as actually attaining \"absolute zero\" or calculating pi to its final decimal value. The feats are impossible to achieve, not because we do not understand something about theoretical physics or the universe, but because we refuse to acknowledge that there are breaks in the laws of what we are capable of, as finite relative approximating creatures. \\n\\nThe answer to Einsteins issue about whether the moon was there or not when he turned his back, and particle-wave duality is not a question of physics; it\\'s a question of whether or not we can accept that only does the infinite body become realized, in other words, conceptualized as or made finite, when it is relatively and therefor finitely approximated in its value by the perceiving body and thus pulled out of nowhere, into a world of abstraction. The duality of particles depends on whether or not we approximate them, because in truth they are infinite. Infinite bodies cannot exist however, by definition, because a boundary must be drawn, and so it becomes rather, a question of perception and skew and nothing else.\\n\\n- Forrest Reed'},\n",

What we think of as particles are interactions between these waves, including Einstein's experiment. In Einstein's experiment the photon wave has, depending on various details, some probability of interacting with the electron wave, and when it happens, the electron wave changes its path and electron gets ejected. In the double slit experiment the single photon wave passes through both slits, the passage affecting the details of its probability of interacting with other waves. The single photon wave hits the screen at a single or rather confined location because when it interacts with the electron waves in the screen, it has to do so at the location of a single electron wave (I have to reconfirm my memory that a  single photon can only interact with a single particle at a time), the wave does not collapse into a particle, but interacts with a single other wave and we observe this interaction AT THE LOCATION of the electron (i.e. it is localization but not really a wave collapse or change from wave to particle). The part I am still working my understand through is how passing through a slit affects the probability distribution for interacting with electrons.\"},\n",

Steve itself mentioned this in an interview.. The early precursor of these companies are innovative and filled with people passionately believing in the innovation they are bringing, They work hard and take risks to make a leap of faith. Lo and behold they introduce something brilliant and grows tremendously. The golden ideas they build their success on becomes the mainstream and the companies slowly push the innovation driven risk takers out of the board room into back offices and research jobs. The marketing and the sales types get promoted as they are considered to be the ones bringing in the customers and the money. The marketing guys at best understands what goes inside of their products in a trivial fashion or they understand only sales numbers and customer feedback. They simply cant connect the dots well.\\nThey don't understand that the DNA of a great product is forward thinking before the market and having vision and commitment to make that into a reality. A path breaking product cannot be build just on customer feedback alone because most customers know only the current possibility. The marketing leaders in the board room also don't get it. The Xerox case or the Kodak case exactly demonstrates it. \\nThe R&D types who are never in the board rooms are rarely is listened to. Steve's brilliance is understanding how a customer would understand the value of a technology. One of his critical abilities was to translate and package technology in the way a consumer will want to experience it. In short Product vision. To be a product leader you should be both a technocrat as well as a first class business executive.\\nEven Steve didn't really succeed with the Mac. It was not a run away financial success as Steve expected.  Apple made more money from Lisa than the Mac. He was pushed out of the company by Scully over differences on strategy. He then went on to make Next computer, a high end computer for education sector. Steve went back to perfecting technology, understand emerging technologies and learning the ropes of market innovation in Next. One thing he always did was to surrounding him with the best engineering and design people. He was willing to pay premium for that.\\nMost people don't how advanced Next OS was in 1992-93. It had all features like seamless mail integration and clickable context based content processing with rich media, seamless content type detection and data sharing between applications. etc. The OS was entirely written using OOP(Object oriented programming) paradigm(Except for the core kernel I believe).\\nApple was slowly losing market share through the early 90's since Scully based it on the DTP  use-cases that Steve had identified for it and then they stopped innovating. Some of the disgruntled team in Apple left and created BeOS and the  BeBox. I had worked with this OS too. Very advanced for its time. Steve was reinventing himself and his strategic vision.  Luckily for him, Apple was in dire straits by 95-96. They had terrible failure in bringing a true Mult-tasking operating system with advancements in memory management. Meanwhile Next and BeOS were by the time doing true pre-emptive multitasking which optimizes the way application uses memory and cpu resources. Meaning faster and responsive system on relatively cheaper hardware that allowed users to quickly switch between Back ground and foreground tasks.\\nApple bought NExt for the technology and Steve insisted on his old position in the company. He ruthlessly threw people who opposed him out of the firm. He was battle hardened and experienced by now. Steve created his own team of brilliant engineers. The first product that came out was the iMAC, those beautiful well engineered machines with translucent cases with monitors and the computer in one enclosure. That was Steves move to get his customers excited in Apple again, with a computer of great aesthetic and user experience value. Apple was back in the innovation business. The engineering core of the NExt OS became the MacOS X. The rest is history.\"},\n",

       "   {'topLevelComment': 'Education was something that a few really interested individuals did in the past. Not because they had to, but because they were hungry for knowledge and wanted to learn. Even today you walk into any university or industry and you will find that there are but a handful of people who actually love what they do or know what they are doing. Without them these institutions or companies will fade away or collapse in time.  However, today more than ever in human history, children are sent to school. Many of them from families with little or no education. These parents have never experienced higher levels of thinking. In fact this is a territory in their view where pain resides.  Intelligence is associated with dishonesty and corruption. So they plant this seed into their children’s minds at an early age. It is also likely that learning is not high on their priority list. So, they enter the education system and the world expects miracles. And miracles do happen but not of the same magnitude or rate  that people expect. Now I am not saying that the education system is perfect by any means. But neither are our expectations. For the masses, enslaved by ignorance, out dated beliefs and ideas  we need to adjust our expectations. The idea of revolution in the education system is nonsense. I dislike revolutions as they are very disruptive, costly, unpredictable and cannot be managed. It makes a good show and makes a possibly a few bucks, but it is irresponsible and naive. Education system has been changing, but the task ahead is of such magnitude that it will take time, possibly a few generations to see the outcome. We must not forget that at no time during human history the rate at which scientific and technological discoveries occur has been of such speed and magnitude. To blame the education system when people are still struggling with nationalism, xenophobia, tribal mentality, bigotry and a multitude of other social problems is simply unfair and undermines the good work of many who have dedicated their life to it.'},\n",

I have a knack for learning and working hard and teaching and learning some more but it just feels the education systems are a dead end and it's time, actually it's been time since decades that the mainstream education system reinvents itself.

       "   {'topLevelComment': 'At the core of every „problem” is: what is what we want. That is driven by values. What do WE consider as valuable and what not? Kids have an extreme tendency to exactly follow the values and ideas communicated to them by their parents. As parents you have to be really carful if your own attitude encourages or discourages learning. The U.S., but also many other societies are driven by stereotypes and ideologies:\\xa0 EVERY German is punctual. EVERY Asian is smart. Most of the them are plain wrong. But media keeps repeating them, as people LOVE hearing ideology that has been taught to them. If give this warm feeling of false confidence.\\nThere are a couple of stereotypes and values typical for the U.S., that harm education in certain social groups.\\n1.)\\xa0“You have to work hard to make it”. Mostly wrong. In an industrialized society you have to work smart to make it. The hard work is done by the cheapest people that only have one skill to offer: muscle power. Those are the worst paid jobs. In the US usually done by immigrants.\\n2.)\\xa0“Don’t depend on others. A real man makes it on his one.” Mostly wrong. That might have been true for a short period during the colonization, where there was nobody else available. But in todays world cooperation and collaboration are essential factors to success.\\n3.)\\xa0“Don’t waist your time learning. You can learn it on the job. Go make money”. No. You can’t. Todays works has gotten so complex and complicated, that without proper training you are not being accepted for higher paid jobs at all. You need to continue to learn while on the job. But without the proper foundation only very few will make it.\\n4.)\\xa0“They will anyways not accept you – don’t even try”. If you are black you just can’t make it. Wrong. You can be the US president. But if you never start learning you will never get anywhere\\nThese stereotypes typically infect the minds of lower class and lower middle-class people, who usually have a low education level themselves. And they pass them on to their children. \\nIt is a measured fact that the success of children in the education system strongly depends on the attitude of their parents to the value of education. E.g. in Finland you have to work smart. You can’t just go out and be a farmer. The weather conditions in Finland are way to harsh. In Finland you can only survive if you use advanced technologies. You MUST learn. The more advanced the better. The same applies to Japan. 80% of Japan are too step for farming. In these countries’ education is one the highest values. IN many parts of the U.S. it is not.\\nThe talk isn’t all wrong. But the key issue is: only when U.S. parents (not the government) VALUE education as really important the situation will change.'},\n",

My education was  great from 1st-5th grade, and it kept me interested in school (even though I was always average grades wise, I still learned a ton and strived to learn as much as I could about what interested me) even when it was torture for me in middle school. Like I said I was lucky to have great teachers and it really does carry through life for me, but it always made me sad to see many of my classmates weren't at all interested in school, they passed but didn't really learn anything. I wish school included more art, and history, along with study of world cultures and lessons about real life situations (like mental illness or realistic sexual education lessons). I would've loved to have known about the rest of the world as a child instead of just learning about the US because when you open your eyes to other cultures  you can see just how interesting the world is and education a lot more attractive then.\"},\n",

Quantum bits or 'qubits' can exist in a superposition state of both zero and one simultaneously. This means that a set of two qubits can be in a superposition of four states, which therefore require four numbers to uniquely identify the state. So the amount of information stored in N qubits is two to the power of N classical bits.\\n\\nThank you to Andrea Morello and UNSW. For more info, check out: http://bit.ly/17wZ7lt\",\n",

He states that sometimes the stuff that's going on in your body can have a major impact on what goes on in your head vice-versa what's going on in your head can affect what's going on in your body.  The course is about the interconnection between physiology and behaviour and the way that the psychological, neurological and biological elements impact each other to create the wildly unpredictable thing known as human behaviour. Because of the complexity of human behavior, we think about things in categories, which makes them easier to understand. But, there are problems with categorical thinking. They can limit, distort and misrepresent thinking. You have trouble seeing differences among items that are in the same category, you overestimate how different they are when there's a boundary between them, and when you're focused on the categorical boundaries, you don't see the big picture.\"},\n",

Some animals intermixed in their grazing, but most grazed the plains in succession.  Massive herds of gigantic bison ate the bounty of the grasslands at a slightly different time than the different huge deer and elk species and other mammals.  One type of mammal might eat the emerging shoots as they migrated through an area, followed later by another groups of mammals eating more mature grass, followed by others eating tall standing grass, and others preferring the dried grasses, etc.  Mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses liked colder areas closer to the glaciers.  Smaller deer (without the massive antlers of their larger cousins) grazed in the forests.  But all these animals migrated seasonally through the feeding areas, eating the available food at different times, rarely competing for the exact same resource.  As they moved through, they trampled the grasses and left their dung and urine (and sometimes their bones when they fell to four-legged predators or human hunters) to nourish the soil as Allan Savory described.  The grasslands renewed themselves every year until the retreat of the glaciers changed the climate.  \\n\\nAs others have mentioned, America was much like this when we had single bison herds numbering in the millions migrating across the western plains.  But those grasslands were also shared by other large herds of  mammal species also migrating through at different times as well.  Therefore, it seems to me that if we could restore herds of mixed species to some of our desertified lands, we might achieve what Allan Savory has done in his projects.  I hope he is consulting with the American government and park service to do just that!  But we'd also have to restore their natural predators to keep the herds in check (Savory mentioned the lions in the African projects.)\"},\n",

If few animals do not join but allowed to graze uncontrolled, these few animals WILL overgraze (and kill) the most edible grass species and at the same time grow better then their \\'colleagues\\' in the herd... \\nSo all farmers with grazing animals have to be convinced for their animals to join the herd.

Directed by Josh Cooley (“Riley’s First Date?”) and produced by Jonas Rivera (“Inside Out,” “Up”) and Mark Nielsen (associate producer “Inside Out”), Disney•Pixar’s “Toy Story 4” ventures to U.S. theaters on June 21, 2019.\\n \\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PixarToyStory/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/toystory\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ToyStory/\\n \\nCopyright: (C) Disney•Pixar',\n",

       "  'description': 'Does quantum entanglement make faster-than-light communication possible?\\nWhat is NOT random? http://bit.ly/NOTrandoVe\\nFirst, I know this video is not easy to understand. Thank you for taking the time to attempt to understand it. I\\'ve been working on this for over six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with two of them).\\n\\nDoes hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden variables must update faster than light - they would be considered \\'non-local\\'. On the other hand if you don\\'t consider the spins before you make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don\\'t exist and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be conserved in the universe.\\n\\nEveryone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability of up/down.\\n\\nSpecial thanks to:\\nProf. Stephen Bartlett, University of Sydney: http://bit.ly/1xSosoJ\\nProf. John Preskill, Caltech: http://bit.ly/1y8mJut\\n\\nLooking Glass Universe: http://bit.ly/17zZH7l\\nPhysics Girl: http://bit.ly/PhysGirl\\nMinutePhysics: http://bit.ly/MinPhys\\nCommunity Channel: http://bit.ly/CommChannel\\nNigel, Helen, Luke, and Simon for comments on earlier drafts of this video.\\n\\nFilmed in part by Scott Lewis: http://google.com/+scottlewis\\n\\nMusic by Amarante \"One Last Time\": http://bit.ly/VeAmarante',\n",

Thats because the first particle measured was measured in the first one right. And because of this the occurrence is 2/3.

Nowadays every Tom, D i c k and Harry thinks he knows it, but he is mistaken. -Albert Einstein 1954\\n\\nLine of sight charged particles are connected by electrostatic force F=Ke x pq/rr, that force is constantly at work. Therefore line of sight charged particles are electrically entangled.\\n\\nThe repulsion force between 2 electrons at distance r is F=Ke x ee/rr. That force act as a mass less stiff rod, connected the 2 electrons as 1. Electrostatic force rules the universe. It responsible for quantum entanglement, light, energy, induction, gravity and magnetism, all nature phenomena.\\n\\nAll maters are connected in space by two forces. Gravity and electron's repulsion force. Electrons are on the surface of all maters, therefore line of sight electrons are constantly repelling each other.\\n\\nThat repelling force transfers thermal energy from the Sun to Earth outer atmosphere instantly, becomes light wave and pass through air at speed C.\"},\n",

The survivors of this cataclysm eventually became the Egyptians, who carried on the ancient knowledge of the previous civilization. All confirmed Egyptian tombs are thoroughly decorated with heiroglyphics yet not a single pyramid found in Egypt contains even a single heiroglyphics, nor has a mummy ever been found in a pyramid. On top of that, there is no known heiroglyph that says or shows anything about the pyramids or their building. There is no actual evidence that the Egyptians built the pyramids, other than the location and the knowledge of the civilzation.\\n\\nBecause of this information and the nearly definitive evidence that there was a massive cataclysm caused by an impact 13,000 years ago (which also ties in really well the the great flood, which is scientifically proven to have happened through geological evidence of massive changes in sea level and deposits of marine life in areas far above sea level), I believe it is possible that an advanced civilization existed before the Egyptians (before Sumerians as well) and is responsible for building the Great Pyramid.

Universal health care, education, basic living wage, are slowly being eroded by ideologues hell bent on reinstating dynastic feudal 'capitalism' and a return to class stratified societies. And often the agents of reversion are right wing politicians with a religious platform. Why? Why are the right leaning political classes so uncharitable? Because they profit from the charities that spring up in the face of inequity and repression. They need more disenfranchised poor and downtrodden, more grist for the mill, or they don't get into heaven, and the other side wins... In Australia more and more social services, paid for by taxpayers!, are being subsumed into the hands of the cronies of the religious right in politics, so they can profit from the public purse and push a particular religious ideology, to keep it current and relevant in an increasingly secular society. And one reason why this is being done is because there are fewer and fewer legitimate businesses from whom to collect tax. Policies have been put into place that make Australia a place hostile to doing business in the traditional sense. We cannot make anything here, a nation with every single natural resource imaginable, and energy of any kind to burn, and a population of (what used to be) well educated, willing workers. Australia has been attacked by right wing ideologues since the 70's, entities hell bent on turning the country into a gravel pit owned by foreign oligarchs, presided over by people who would feel at home chopping the limbs off babies in the Belgian Congo... utterly determined to destroy any semblance of a social welfare state.\"},\n",

Mr Krugman pontificates as if no one with a lower income is aware of what wealth is or how it\\'s managed.\\n\\nHe has foolishly trotted out that canard about health insurance and how the HCRA benefitted people. Firstly, he demonstrates his own naive understanding of what health care is like in the USA for people of low to moderate income.\\n\\n There are 3 basic ways low income people receive health care, and it hasn\\'t changed by any significance since the passage of the HCRA. \\n1- Show up as an emergency indigent person in need.\\n2- Medicare recipient.\\n3- Health insurance through employment. This is where most people who have insurance obtain it. The worse part is, premiums have escalated significantly as well as deductibles, and co-pays. \\nA small fraction of the population, who were unable to afford health insurance, still can\\'t because even the government site is ridiculous. It\\'s like paying COBRA rates. The burden for states, already having financial difficulties, increased substantially when their Medicare coverage costs escalated to cover the totally uninsured who applied for subsidies. So where or in what tangible (not theoretical) way have we benefitted through the passage of the HCRA?\\n\\nThere\\'s this imagined bogeyman called \"the wealthy\", which as the story goes in Capitalism 101, we\\'re to aspire, but once you have wealth, you\\'re selfish, greedy, and undeserving. How\\'s that work for you?\\n\\nIf that\\'s your target to save the country, you\\'ve done a ready fire aim approach. \\n\\nIf you want to use statistics then what are the wealthy paying in real-time tax dollars after credits, deductions, etc? I\\'m not talking about the legal entities, corporations, but the people who work and or own major shares. \\n\\nThose 10% wealthy, Krugman refers to pay over 70% of the taxes. Furthermore, even during times of higher or more progressive tax rates, the money collected for the treasury has remained around 17.5% effective. \\n\\nWhat isn\\'t being addressed, and continues to be our American challenge is the vast difference we collect in taxes vs. what we as a nation spend.\\n\\nI\\'ve been a working person since I was 15 and never obtained much wealth, but I can still say, I\\'ve lived well and I haven\\'t lost any sleep over what the wealthy receive in compensation or gave accumulated. If Mr. Krugman is feeling burdened or guilty from his aggregate economic benefits, I will gladly swap saving, investments, and bank accounts with him.\\n\\nThe America I live in, for almost 7 decades, is a far more kind and generous country than what Mr. Krugman claims. His description of \"an ugly America\" is far from what I\\'ve seen. And yes, I\\'ve seen most of it. These alarmist claims, based on incorrect assumptions and data defy what people who have worked most of their lives to achieve. Unlike the summary given by Bill Moyers, I don\\'t envy nor am I jealous of the Bezos, Buffets, Gates, Soros, Koch brothers, or the Walton family. Should they be forced by law to pay those who work for them more money, or pay higher taxes? I guess that\\'s still open for debate, but in so far as I have learned, if you personally produce or possess something of great value, then you\\'re very likely to be compensated according to that value.'},\n",

You don’t always have to numb yourself to escape. We just need to heal and TM is the only thing I’ve come across that helps you heal from within.

Basically: going along to get along. I eventually quit, with no AA, no counseling, no chemical treatment – just comprehensive disgust with alcohol, its effect upon my life, and its prevalence in the world around me. For the first few months (after getting down to regular-but-moderate amounts), I fell into a deep depression, which apparently occurs because the brain grows accustomed to alcohol's presence for the endophin action. After riding that out, I felt great, getting re-acquainted with my true self, and have no compulsion ever to drink acohol.\"}]}]"
